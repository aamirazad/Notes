Also called Oedipus the King

### Lines 1-340

- The play starts in the royal house of Thebes
- Oedipus had killed the Spinx years ago and has been king of Thebes since
- But he doesn't know he killed is father and doesn't know he married his mother
- Priests enter saying the city is sick with plague
  - Crops are ruined, cattle are sick, women die in labor and children are stillborn, and people are perishing from the plague
  - The priest begs Oedipus to save Thebes, just as Oedipus once saved it from the Sphinx
  - _Everyone believes Oedipus is a true hero, Oedipus knows this and thinks very highly of himself_

  - Only one eyewitness survived who returned to Thebes

- The Chorus who had not heard of this, sings

- Oedipus orders anyone who knows of anything to speak up

  - "Let that man drag out his life in agony, step by painful step."
  - Going as far as to say even if the killer is in his own family, they will get the same harsh treatment, if they don't speak up
  - He actually cursed himself
  - He says he will fight for Laius as if Laius were his own father

    - The killer of Laius is a native Theban whom many think is a foreigner; he will soon be blind; he is both brother and father to his children; he killed his own father.
- The Chorus gives their stance on the situation
  - _The Chorus acts as the common consensus of the people_

	- Roseellini was the son of a weather family
	- He experimented with living like a caveman of the shors of Prince William Sound
	- His experiment was to decide if it was possible to independent of modern technology
		- Convinced humans had devolved into inferior beings
	- This experiment kept going for more than a decade

	- McCunn fantasizes the girls he tried to convince to join him on the trip will come and rescue him
	- As he is dying of starvation and shoots himself

# Crisis in europe  
  
### Economic and social crises  
  
Inflation  
  
- Major influx of gold and silver from Americas  
- Growing populations  
- Went from 60 mil to 85 mil in 100 years  
  
#### Prior knowledge  
  
- The black death crashed the economy  
- Less working = less food  
- The Spanish conquered the Inca and Aztec leading to in an influx of gold amd silver from mines such as Potosi (Mankind)  
  
### Witchcraft trials  
  
- Because people believed in witchcraft during this time, common people (poor women) were accused of witchcraft meaning they would be tortured to confess to practices they didn't do.  
- But later people realized believing in spells and stuff didn’t make sense and stopped in 1650  
  
#### Prior knowledge  
  
- In english class, we learned about the rest cure used during the 1860s in [[The Yellow Wallpaper|The Yellow Wallpaper]]  
- During this time, woman, after giving birth who were struggling win the hormone-  changes, were accused of being crazy  
- In order to cure this they were forced to rest which was being trapped in a room doing nothing till they get better  
  
### Thirty Year’s War  
  
- The war started because Calvinism was not recognized in Germany.  
- The war took place in the Holy Roman Empire between the Catholic and Calvinist nobles.  
- This war was very destructive, involving most of europe. In the end, France emerged on top but not without causing massive population loss and destruction  
  
#### Prior knowledge  
  
- Just like all other wars, this one was very destructive.  
- Similar to the [[Hundred Year's War|Hundred Year's War]], France came on top which changed a lot of dynamics, but unlike it, the war was about religion and not government  
  - Both involved guns heavy  
- In addition, one of the major effects was famine and population loss similar to the [[The Black Death Review|Black Death]]  
  
### The Changing Face of War  
  
- Because of the rapid development of gun powered guns, guns during this war changed the war  
- The flintlock musket involved gunpowder lit by a flint making it easier to fire  
- Also a bayonet, a steel blade used in close proximity fighting was provided  
- Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, military leader experienced in firearms  
  - Salvo  
    - Each person fired independently instead of in rows  
- France had a army of 400,000  
  
#### Prior knowledge  
  
- Just like when the gun was first largely used in the [[Hundred Year's War|Hundred Year's War]], this more advanced gun changed how wars were fought dramatically  
- Also, a new fighting method was used like in the [[Topic 3 Lesson 5 “Winning Independence” Notes Corrected|American revolution]]  
  
### Revolutions in England  
  
- During the Thirty Year's War, England also had a war of their own. A civil war called the English Revolution  
  - Power struggle between the king and the Parliament  
  - It would take another revolution to resolve it  
- The Stuarts and Divine Right  
  - The Stuart was a long line of rules  
  - King James I believed in the divine right of kings  
    - Kings receive their power from God, the Parliament did not like this  
- The Puritans wanted to make the English church more Protestant  
  - The upper class were becoming Puritan (Protestants inspired by Calvinist ideas)  
- Charles I  
  - Accepted a petition from the Parliament that made the Parliament's consent required for the passing of any taxes  
  - Also, he tried to impose the Church of England more, causing the Puritans to leave to America  
- In 1642 England went into Civil war between the supporters of the king and the parliamentary forces  
  - Parliament won because of the New Model Army of Oliver Cromwell made up of Puritans who believed they were fighting for god  
  - They executed Charles I  
    - Parliament abolished the monarchy, declaring England a republic  
- Cromwell died and the Parliament restored the monarchy  
  - Parliament introduced Exclusion Bill, stopping James from the thrown as a catholic  
  - Two groups were created: the Whigs who didn't like James, and the Tories who wanted to follow the bloodline  
- Charles dismissed Parliament and James II become king causing conflict with him and parliament  
- William and James's daughter Mary invaded England  
- Created the bill of rights  
  - Gave the Parliament the right to make laws and set taxes, England could only fight with their consent  
  - Also created a government with a freely elected Parliament  
- Parliament passed the Toleration Act to grant Puritans free worship  
  
#### Prior knowledge  
  
- This revolution is very similar to the even that still hasn't happened, the [[Topic 3 Lesson 4 “The Move Toward Independence” Notes|American Revolution]] against Britain  
  - They are similar in that both have a power struggle of who gets to make decisions on the people like to make taxes  
  - They are dissimilar because the American revolution involved lots of fighting while the revolutions in England took place in the government  
- Also the question about religion is a very common issues such as what caused the [[Reformation|Reformation]]

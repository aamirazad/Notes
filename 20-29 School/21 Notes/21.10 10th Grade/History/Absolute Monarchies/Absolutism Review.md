# Absolutism review  
  
### Throwback  
  
> [!question] In what ways did the Reformation and Exploration strengthen or weaken the kings in Europe  
>  
> - In the short term, Reofrmation made them weaker cause they had less power but exploration made them stronger because they had more resources  
> - In the long term, exploration made them weaker because they would lose a lot of people who move out and start their own country (US)  
  
### Divine right  
  
- Kings said gods chose the king and they had all the power  
- Challenged by the enlightenment and age of reason  
  
### Absolutism  
  
- Absolute monarchs  
  - Slowly is building to create the French revolution  
  - Power struggle with the pope too  
  
### Structure  
  
- Monarch rules with no 'checks and balances'  
- [[The Renaissance#Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] (better to be feared than loved) would have loved this  
- Benefits  
  - Clear decision maker  
  
### Control  
  
- Kings control government, mobility, economics, and power  
- Two ways to control the people  
  - Kill the powerful  
  - Distract them from rebelling (trick them into thinking everything is good)  
  
### Spanish  
  
- King Phillip II  
  - 50,5000 soldiers paid for by the [[Columbus|Potosi mountain]] (the big silver mountain)  
  
### French  
  
- King Louis XIV  
  - Sun king  
  - Weakens the nobles by distracting them with rituals in his Palace of Versailles  
  - 200 people would wake the king up and help him because it was a honor (wasted their time)  
  - Everyone was brainwashed into thinking he was amazing, didn't rebel quite as fast  
  - Everybody got mad at the tax collectors even though the king was the one getting the money, nobody believed the king was bad  
  
### Economic growth  
  
- Jean baptiste Colbert  
  
### Grand style  
  
- Put luxury everywhere  
- While everyone is arguing over while will help the king in the morning instead of focusing on the government  
- The king would eat super fancy food from all over while the common people would eat bread mixed with sawdust  
  - Sawdust had no colories but made you feel full temporarily

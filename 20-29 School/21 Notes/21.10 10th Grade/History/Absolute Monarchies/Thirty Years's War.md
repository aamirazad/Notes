> [!question] In a few sentences: How did the Protestant Reformation lead to the 30 Years' War? What were the major impacts of this conflict?
> Due to the fact that the Reformation reformed for more religious freedom and knowledge about religion, this lead to the 30 Years's War. One of the main causes of the 30 years's war was religious conflict between the Catholic and Protestant which started in Germany. There was also territorial conflicts which created tension such as as the Habsburg's domination in Europe. This made country's like France use the 30 years war as a excuse to deal with imposing threats. Although, very quickly, other nations joined the war and fought. The major impacts of this war was lots of inhumain death and destruction of solders and Germany citizens along with the shift of power from Spain and Germany to France and England. Lastly, Calvinism joins Lutheranism and Catholicism as the 3 main religions in Europe because of this.

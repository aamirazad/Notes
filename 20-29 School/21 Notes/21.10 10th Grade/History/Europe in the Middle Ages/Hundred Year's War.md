# Hundred Year's War

- 1337 -1453 (166 years)
- A series of wars
- Conflict between the English and the French.
- Fighting because of anger at each other and who gets the thrown
  - Who can be king
  - Each thought they could rule over the other
  - Causes stem way back to the Norman Conquest (1066)

England is more united than France. United is better because people don't fight each to other.

The two are intermarried. So if the king doesn't have a son then the other country can take over

King dies. Two fight over who becomes king.

- The king's doughter's husband (the English king)
- The king's brother's son (French dude) The English King gets mad that the french dude was chose and goes to war
- The French had the advantage because they had a lot more people and horses. But because the English had the longbow man they dominate the early war.

### The battle of crecy

- The English has the high ground so they pick off the French who can't climb up the hill. 100 English to 15,000 casualties

Cannon:

- Big, cumbersome. Not moveable. Kinda powerful though. Used with the awesome longbow during Cresy.

### The battle of pointers (1356)

- Kings son shows up on the battlefield, invades France.
- King dead

### The battle of agincow (1415)

- These battles are sparse. Long periods in between
- French complete destroyed

### The treaty of troyes (1420)

- Truce
- Both kings get married, kid rules both
- Treaty gets wiped out; everyone dies

### Joan of arc

- Peasant, girl, teenage leaders a army (unusual)
- Said she was getting divine messages from god. Predicts an event to prove it
- Dresses like a boy

### The siege of orleans

- Siege against France
- Joan of Arc helps French fight back
- First French victory

Joan of Arc was then captured by the English and because they thought she was a witch and was causing french victory, they burn her at the stake

After this the French fight back harder and with the help of the gun they win the war.

### Effects

- France and English are real countries
- New weapons
- No more soldiers on horseback
- France becomes a union nation, separate parts, like state in the US

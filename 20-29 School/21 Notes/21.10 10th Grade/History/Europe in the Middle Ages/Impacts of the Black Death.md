## Short-Term Impacts  
  
| Impact/Event      | 2-3 sentences about what it does- think of impacts to society, economics, personal lives, religion, art, etc.                                                                                                                                  |  
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| Very religious    | As the black plague swept through Europe people had to come to terms with the threat of death. To protect themselves and their families some people became very religious in hopes that god would save them.                                   |  
| Quarantining      | Because many people didn’t know how the black death spread, many people were forced to stay home. This caused them to become depressed because they don’t see people for long periods of time.                                                 |  
| Anti-Semitism     | Some people began to blame the jews for the cause of the plague. Thousands of jews were persecuted and killed throughout Europe.                                                                                                               |  
| Economic collapse | After millions of farmers, traders, and workers died there was a massive shortage of goods across Europe. This led to inflation and a general economic collapse. Many people stopped using set currency until trade and agriculture recovered. |  
| YOLO              | Certain people and groups started to give up on life, and just accept the fact that they were going to get the plague and die. They began to drink heavily and party a lot, in the case that “you only live once.”                             |  
  
## Long-Term Impacts  
  
| Impact/Event               | 2-3 sentences about what it does- think of impacts to society, economics, personal lives, religion, art, etc.                                                                                                                                                       |  
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| Collapse of Feudalism      | The plague killed lots of peasants, so lords had a harder time finding workers. With less workers, the cost of each worker went up. Peasants started demanding more money as a result.                                                                              |  
| Inflation of currency      | After the collapse of the workforce and the resources shortages in Europe the average European started paying more for almost everything. This caused the value of what you could buy for a pound to decrease and cause inflation.                                  |  
| Trauma                     | The trauma of all the death and the loss of lost ones caused Europe to change. Many people had to learn to deal with living with death. This could be seen in art, music, and life.                                                                                 |  
| Population drop            | Europe lost almost half its population, starting from around 78 million to around roughly half of what it was. It took until around the 1600s to completely build the lost population back.                                                                         |  
| The collapse of the Church | Because of the black death and the pope’s recommendations concerning it, many people lost trust in the Church. For example, the pope told people to throw the dead body’s in the river. This polluted the water and many people didn’t trust the Church after this. |

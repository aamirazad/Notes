# Rome and the Rise of Christianity

### The rise of Rome

- Rome had to be under the control of 7 kids 2 of which were Etruscans

Once the Etruscans were overthrown, some changes happened to Rome.
Rome became a republic, this would prove to be a major reason for it's success

- Overthrew Carthage

This secured their dominance

### The setup (of Rome)

- The ruling class, the patricians, were great landowners
- The less wealthy were called plebeians

Lost of fighting between the two

### Republic to Empire

- Changed to swearing an oath of loyalty to the general, not the Roman state
- Caesar to Octavian to Augustus

Augustus was named imperaor, which is emperor. This first emperor was a big turning point in the Roman government.
After that, five emperors came into power, and slowly gave themselves more and more power at the expense of the Senate.
These five emperors crated a period of peace called the Pax Romana, Roman peace.

- Rome thrived, covered 3 and a half square miles. Population > 50 million

### Law

- Rome's first laws was the Twelve Talbes; only applied to Romans
- Law of nations was made that all people follow. Called natural law
- Crated innocent until proven guilty

### Conditions

- Slavery very much present, one revolt in Italy was the biggest
- Rome was overcrowded, loud. Big gap between rich and poor
- Poor lived in Insulae
- Lots of public programs, food for the poor, entertainment

### Culture

- Latin literature peaked in the Age of Augustus
- Most distinguished poet was Vigil
- Wrote about Rome conquering the world

While taking inspiration from the Greeks, Romans architecture, art, and engineering made Rome extremely developed for the time

- The aqueducts that provided a million people a fresh of water is a good example of this

### Christianity in Rome

- Judaea, where Jesus had preached, was taken over by Rome
- Because of the thoughts that Jesus could cause a revolt, we was crucified
- With people saying Jesus overcame death, Christianity spread
- Accounts of Jesus was written down and made into the New Testament, the second part of the bible
- Christianity gave mean and purpose, formed communities, and was attractive to all classes.

But because Christians did not worship state gods and emperors, the Roman government pushed back. Only when Constantine became emperor was Christianity officially tolerated.

### The Decline

- Changed into the Late Roman Empire. Came with changes like a new government structure, new economic and social system, and Christianity as the state religion
- Divided into four parts, each with a ruler

Diocletian and Constantine competed for power, each making large armies. This took away from public funds

- Constantine becomes the sole ruler in 324
- A great city called Constantinople was created along with this "New Rome" project
- Western Roman empire had invading Germanic tribes to deal with
- Germanic, because of the Huns, moved into Rome and settled as allies
- Germanic Visigoths revolted, Romans then tried to suppress the revolt, and lost
- Visigoths take over Rome. A new group, the Vandals, took over Spain, Africa, Italy, then also Rome
- Emperor Augustaus was removed marking the fall of the Western Roman Empire. 476

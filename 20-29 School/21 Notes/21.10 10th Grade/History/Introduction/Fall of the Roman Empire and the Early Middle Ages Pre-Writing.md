# Fall of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages Pre-Writing  
  
> [!question] What were several accomplishments of Rome?  For each, give a brief synopsis and explain the significance. Why is the fall of the Roman Empire historically significant, even in the 1400s?  
  
## Intro  
  
Rome had many accomplishments in different areas, political, engineering, and transportation which revolutionized these areas forever.  
  
### Thesis  
  
The many accomplishments of Rome influenced the rest of the world even thousands of years after they fell.  
  
## Body  
  
- Rome invented aqueducts which revolutionized water supply giving an easy water supply to a million of people. “A dozen aqueducts kept a population of one million supplied with water.” pg. 72. The benefits of having a fresh supply of water helped Rome grow and prosper. Also there were other benefits that impacted many Romans. One example of this was how, “Romans relished the pleasure of water in their baths and ornamental fountains.” [Source](https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwat.12958#pane-pcw-references)  
- They made a republican form of government which would be an example for governments for thousands of years. “Romans overthrew the last Etruscan king and established a republic … This was the beginning of a new era in Rome’s history.” pg. 67. This improved general living conditions like providing public services and having a common defense. [Source](https://www.ipl.org/essay/Pros-And-Cons-Of-The-Roman-Republic-FKWJQY3RCED6)  
- Rome spread christianity, which helped the country become more connected and improved its people’s support of the country. “Christianity spread throughout the empire and eventually became the state religion of Rome.” pg. 66. There were many benefits to spreading so widely, like unifiting Rome and helping the poor’s mental health. [Source](https://www.ipl.org/essay/How-Did-Christianity-Change-Roman-Culture-FJR87YVUZV)  
- Rome was responsible for spreading Latin. “Roman achievements in law, government, language, and engineering influenced Western civilization.” pg. 48. This made Rome a greater power, further enhancing their dominance.  
- Rome made concrete an easy and widely used material which is still one of the most used construction materials today. “The Romans were the first people in antiquity to use concrete on a massive scale.” pg. 72. These materials were very helpful in making Rome a strong advanced civilization.  
- Rome used the arch to make giant structures like the Colosseum and the pantheon that would stand for thousands of years. Giant structures were used for intimidation to others and to improve the people's well being.  
  
## Body  
  
- Rome influenced the use of many tools and methods that the rest of the world continued to use. An example of this is the roads they built, “by laying gravel and then paving with rock slabs” which can be seen in other countries for many years.

- Rome’s republic set the standard for countries with a lot of freedom throughout the rest of history. Part of Roman law is seen in the US Constitution.  
- Rome made a road system that is still used today. Their, “complex network of post houses meant that messages and other intelligence could be relayed with astonishing speed.” [Source](https://www.history.com/news/10-innovations-that-built-ancient-rome)  
- Rome’s renaissance changed the way art was created, with various artists coming together and valuing classic ideals once more, such as symmetry and harmony. [Source](https://depts.washington.edu/hrome/Authors/heberj/AncientInflucesonRenaissanceArt/pub_zbarticle_view_printable.html#:~:text=The%20Renaissance%20was%20a%20time,of%20both%20mind%20and%20spirit.)  
- You can see influence in many western structures and culture such as in sports stadiums the oval shapes and the shapes of the seats were extracted from a basic idea that the Romans created. The material that the Colosseum’s arches are made out of concrete which the Romans had created. [Source](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/traces-ancient-rome-modern-world/)  
- Since Rome was the home of the Catholic Church, they had a great impact on Christianity in the rest of Europe. [Source](https://www.ducksters.com/history/ancient_rome/legacy_of_rome.php)  
  
## Conclusion  
  
Based on the evidence, even after its fall, Rome and its many achievements still have influence today even in the western world.

# Tg - qing dynasty  
  
1644-1911  
  
## Geography and climate  
  
The Qing Dynasty is an amazing travel destination with three distinct geographic regions, the northern, southeast, and eastern territories, and the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers. (Qing Dynasty Geography).  
  
The most beautiful and historical part of the Qing Dynasty is the southeast and east. There is a large crescent of land from Beijing to Vietnam that is heavily populated and fertile. (Qing Dynasty Geography). This region is perfect for touring the city. If you are looking for a night out we suggest the city of Liuyang for its amazing nightlife. The territories also have vibrant farms, perfect for a carriage ride along the countryside. The weather in the southeast and eastern territories is very humid during the summer and dry in the fall. Winters are very mild with almost no frost.  
  
During the 18th century, Tibet was conquered. With Tibet came the Himalayan mountains. Whether you are a casual hiker or a risk-taking mountain climber, the Himalayas are perfect. Its high altitude significantly challenges climbers (and any Indian invasions). (Qing Dynasty Geography). If you are a hiker the base of the mountain offers beautiful views of Mount Everest. Additionally, in the region, the climate can be harsh in the winter, and very warm in the summer.  
  
If you are a traveling warrior we have some bad news. Unfortunately, the range has made a definite ending point for any southern expansion. Additionally, in the north, the Taklimakan and Gobi deserts ended any possible expansion for the dynasty. (Qing Dynasty Geography). We advise all of our potential warriors to contact other countries for invasions.  
  
Our travel agency advises travelers to not visit the northern territories of the dynasty because they are heavily disputed. In 1858, Russia conquered the northeast and the Illi Basin and Lake Baikalash in the northwest. The territories were returned through the Treaty of Saint Petersburg. Even though the northern area was highly contested, the land wasn’t very fertile and mostly inhabited. The northern territories have harsh winters and very hot and dry summers. (Qing Dynasty Geography). If you do end up in the northern territory and are in trouble, please contact our travel helpline and we will send a search party for you (please allow 1-2 months for the search party to arrive).  
  
Yellow River is a 3,000-mile-long river that offers amazing opportunities for all Silk Road traders. The river runs from the Baiyan Har Mountains to the Bohai Sea. This river is often used for trade but also for watersports. It also supports the dynasty’s population of over 400 million. If you thought the Yellow River was amazing, check out the Yangtze River which is even longer than the Yellow River. The Yangtze can also be used for even more trade, and watersports as well. (Qing Dynasty Geography).  
  
We advise all of our travelers to check our website for any updates on the current state of the Qing Dynasty.  
  
## Religion  
  
If you are a theologist or are interested in religion, the Qing Dynasty is for you! Confucianism is the most dominant religion in the Qing Dynasty. This information may be surprising to our Europeans, but the Qing Dynasty also tolerates Buddhism, Daoism/Taoism, and Tibetan Lamaism.  
  
Here’s an explanation of the four religions:  
  
Confucianism: The most highly debated topic is whether it was even a religion. Many theologians believe that it may be a philosophy or a way of life, but many refer to it as both a religion and a philosophy. Confucianism was started by Confucious who was a philosopher. His teachings were written down by his disciples in a series of books. Confufucianists do not follow a God, but worshipping their ancestors. In general, Confucianism is about being kind to others. The Golden Rule of Confucianism is to “ Do not do unto others what you would not want others to do unto you.” They also believe in “Cosmic Harmony” which is where good things in the universe will happen if your ruler is very pure and good-willed. (Confucianism).  
  
Buddhism: Originating in India, Buddhism has become one of the largest religions. Again, Europeans do not be afraid, Christianity is still important! Buddhism is the belief that life is supposed to be hard and have a lot of suffering. You can escape this pain by meditating and being a good person you can reach Nirvana, or enlightenment. Buddhists do not follow any Gods but do believe in spirits that can either help or harm your path towards enlightenment. It is believed that Siddhartha Gautama, a wealthy noble, abandoned his life after seeing poor and dying people. He eventually reached a state of Nirvana and is said to be the first to do so. He is now referred to as the Buddha. Buddha had Four Noble Truths, suffering, origin of suffering, cessation of suffering, and path to cessation of suffering. Please be aware that suffering is not a requirement to join Buddhism. Buddhists also think that Karma, which is a person's good or bad actions, can affect them in the future. (Buddhism). If you have done some bad things such as entering the House of Parliament with weapons, catching royal fish or deer, or playing soccer do not be afraid! (7 Obscure Medieval Laws). There is still time to get good karma. We recommend going to Lingyin Temple in the Zhejiang Province. (Lingyin Temple).  
  
Daoism/Taoism (We will refer to it as Daoism): Daoism coexists with Confucianism. Daoism is the belief that your life is only a small part of the long process of nature. Additionally, they think that humans should only do actions that follow the accord of nature. Daoists reject worldly goals such as power, assertiveness, violence, and aggression. (Bloom).  
  
Tibetan Lamaism/Buddhism and Zen Buddhism: Tibetan Buddhism is an offshoot of Buddhism. It is comparable to Protestantism, minus the persecution, and a powerful religious authority. This religion differs from traditional Buddhism as they conduct rituals to fend off these evil spirits and they worship multiple deities. Buddhism is more philosophical, while Tibetan Lamaism/Buddhism is more of a religious practice. (Basic Concepts of Tibetan Buddhism). Zen Buddhism is a school of Buddhism with an emphasis on meditation. They would meditate to reach a state of enlightenment. They believe in living in the present, and not focusing on the future. Japan also practices this type of Buddhism but it is most predominant in China.  (Nagatomo).  
  
The Qing Dynasty has also been introduced to Islam and Christianity. Islam is not very popular in the dynasty. Christianity was followed by around 100,000 people, but also insignificant. (Qing Dynasty Religion). So if you are a missionary looking to spread your religion, the Qing Dynasty is great for you!  
  
## History  
  
The Qing Dynasty is very prosperous and historical. The Manchus took advantage of the Internal conflict in China and conquered it in 1644. The Manchus made alliances with Mongul and Chinese groups who helped them take over China. (Qin Dynasty, 1644-1911). They did not change much of China’s society and kept most traditions and laws. The Qing Dynasty borrowed many practices from the Ming Dynasty while maintaining most Manchu traditions.  
  
Seen as the most prosperous dynasty in the world, many give credit to the three emperors, Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong (See the Government/Leaders section for more info on Kangxi and Qianlong. Sorry Yongzheng fans). (Qing Dynasty 1644-1911).  
  
The Dynasty has some of the best products the Silk Road has to offer. They have beautiful ceramics and enamels, and much more. This country is perfect for any Silk Road trader looking to find new goods to sell. Furthermore, art is very popular, with many artists trying to recreate ancient traditions or make completely new pieces of art. (Qing Dynasty 1644-1911).  
  
On a more solemn note, the Qing Dynasty did go through a rebellion called the White Lotus Rebellion. The Rebellion was started by a group of homeless people who wanted to escape their landowners, tax collectors, etc. These people gathered in the forest near Hubei, Sichuan, and Shaanxi provinces. In the woods, they helped each other survive and created a community called the White Lotus. Eventually, the White Lotus began to rebel, and in 1795, staged a rebellion equipped with gunpowder and swords. The military took relentless and harsh methods to end the uprising. This further angered the members of the White Lotus. They started to recruit more people and started looting multiple villages. After nine years, both sides had hundreds of casualties, but the government won in the end. This proved that the Qing government did not have an effective way to handle domestic issues. If you're looking to start a rebellion, the Qing Dynasty is perfect for you! Please note that the Dynasty is very safe and we did not intend for any potential travelers to be alarmed. (Theobald).  
  
The Qing Dynasty did have a problem with the Opium trade. Europeans implemented unfair trade methods which ruined the economy. The Dynasty had multiple Opium wars that occurred from 1840-42 and 1856-60. This had very bad effects on the Qing and it would lead to many rebellions. After many internal conflicts and rebellions, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in 1911. (Qing Dynasty).  
  
## Economy  
  
For the Qing Dynasty, trade had become such a profitable business that many merchants rejected using silver as a currency and preferred to trade rice. (Qing Dynasty Economy).  
  
Peasants rejoice! In the Qing Dynasty farmers and agriculture were very important. They often received free livestock and seeds. Additionally, farmers were taxed less. Farmers obtained foreign crops from the Americas which they traded for and made an immense profit. This led the Qing Dynasty to make foreign manufacturing and trade regulations to help protect people from monopolies and abuse from Western countries. (Qing Dynasty Economy).  
  
The Canton System allowed the Dynasty to trade with Western countries. This system helped the government monitor transactions and restricted trade to only certain Chinese Guilds.  (Qing Dynasty Economy).  
  
The most popular items that were traded were Chinese-style furniture, lacquer, porcelain, furniture, paintings, sculptures, and tea.  (Qing Dynasty Economy).  
  
Silver was the main currency. The value of silver was based on the purity of the silver and its weight. To find out how pure your silver is you must get it tested, which costs money. So make sure to bring extra tradable goods or silver with you!  (Qing Dynasty Economy).  
  
Unfortunately, the Qing Dynasty went through multiple Opium wars, which were a series of naval battles that were started by the high quantity of opium being imported into the nation.  (Qing Dynasty Economy). These wars have caused great economic ruin in the Dynasty, so buy all of the goods that you can before the state collapses!  
  
## Ties and conflicts with other empires  
  
The Qing Dynasty made a lot of friends (and enemies)! So, if you are visiting from a country that is listed as an alliance, then come on in! If you are an enemy then maybe you should delay your visit. The Qing made many relationships with certain Chinese and Mongol groups which helped the Qing’s conquest of China. (Qing Dynasty, 1644-1911). Additionally, they had many treaties with Russia (the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689) as a result of the constant fighting. The Qing traded with Portugal, Spain, Holland, Japan, and many other South Asian countries, but didn’t have any formal alliances or treaties with them. (Qing Dynasty).  
  
Here’s the fun part! The Qing participated in several wars and invasions. The first is the invasion of the Ming Dynasty. They took advantage of the Ming’s internal conflicts and easily took over the country. Furthermore, they fended off three invasions from the Hans, and multiple from Tsarist Russia, and were able to claim Tawain. The Qing also had multiple rebellions that were not very significant except for the Taiping Rebellion which was very deadly. (Qing Dynasty).  
  
Even though the Qing fought in many wars, we do not recommend coming here just for the fighting because the dynasty is very stable.  
  
## Traditions/Customs  
  
Qing Dynasty traditions are very unique, which is another reason to visit! The most serious, and hated, tradition was for men’s haircuts. In the dynasty, men had to shave the form of their had and comb back the rest. You were not allowed to cut the combed-back hair. This rule was a violation of the Confucian philosophy that hair was a gift from your parents and you must not cut it. Many protested this rule of cutting your hair, which caused the government to respond by killing hundreds of thousands of people. So, if you visit the Qing Dynasty please do not ask for a haircut. (Cultural Impact of Qing Dynasty). Foot Binding was also very popular towards the beginning of the Qing Dynasty. The practice was said to be attractive, and many girls would start binding their feet at a very young age. This dwindled out as women's rights became more important. As the Twentieth Century came foot binding became almost obsolete, only practiced in traditional families in small, rural villages. (Ebrey). They also had many traditions associated with their three main religions (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism). The most important one is Filial Piety, which is a devout respect, and worship of parents and ancestors. This came from Confucian philosophies. (Spielman). For all travelers, we ask you to please research the three religions listed as the Qing Dynasty is heavily influenced by them.  
  
## Art and culture  
  
The Qing Dynasty has a very diverse and prosperous culture. Much like the United States, the Qing had a culture of bettering themselves. Many believed that even a peasant boy could become the most sought-after position of a government official. (Cultural Impact of Qing Dynasty). For all my Shakespeare fans, literature was a big part of the Qing Dynasty’s culture! The most significant work of literature was the Siku Quanshu, which was a collection of over 3,400 books. (Qing Dynasty Culture). Poetry was also very important with even many women writing poetic works. (Women in Traditional China). These books ranged from fiction and joke books to religious texts. Furthermore, the Qing had meeting areas called “Native Places.” These places were used for local people to meet, discuss certain issues, and sell and store goods. These places took a turn for the worse and became secret cults with rituals. (Cultural Impact of Qing Dynasty). So if you visit make sure to bring your candles and cult robes (the Travel Agency is not responsible for any bodily harm that occurs at these meetings)!  
  
Art was treasured in the Qing Dynasty. Many artists painted events that occurred in the Emperor’s court or daily life. European Humanists here is something you will love! Many Qing Dynasty painters try to revitalize and recreate many ancient Chinese pieces. Alternatively, some artists break the rules and make completely new versions of art. Artists mostly painted on porcelain, made sculptures, and some calligraphy. Most of the art was commissioned by the imperial court. (Qing Dynasty, 1644-1911).  
  
If you love any type of art, literature, or calligraphy we recommend visiting the Qing Dynasty!  
  
## Government and leaders  
  
The Qing Dynasty was heavily influenced by the Ming Dynasty. Like most of the world, only men were allowed to take jobs in government jobs. The Qing had a revolutionary idea for their time. Europeans, hold onto your hats. To get a government job you had to first take a test, and pass said test, to be considered for the job. The jobs were either military or civilian, then divided into nine ranks, which were then divided into categories A or B. If you chose to join the military you could have several ranks, including the highest rank of imperial bodyguard. A civilian occupation could be from a secretary to a police commissioner. All in all, you still had to take a test no matter what the job was. Unfortunately, if you are not from the Qing Dynasty, you cannot get a government job. Only, Han Chinese, Manchus, and some Mongols could serve in the dynasty. Here’s where it gets complicated. The Qing were led by an emperor (rejoice!). (Qing Dynasty Government). The title was passed down from father to son. The Qing also had the belief that the emperor had the "Mandate of Heaven." This mandate said that there was a supernatural force that chose the emperor to rule the earth. This let the emperor obtain power, gave them a God-like presence, and made them rule fairly as they believed that their state would suffer if they didn't do righteous things. (Cartwright). Still, the government was split into six ministries with two presidents and four vice presidents (mourn ;( ). The ministries were run by an outer court and an inner court. The outer court was for everyday matters, while the inner court was for more important decisions. The ministries were then split into boards. There were civil, finance, rites (court protocol, worships, etc.), war, and construction and mint boards. This does seem very confusing compared to your typical monarchy, but this system was very efficient and effective. (Qing Dynasty Government). The Social Order of the Qing Dynasty was very typical for the time. At the top of the pyramid was the emperor and his advisors. The next level was Generals, Nobles, and Workers. This social level was the middle class of the social order. These people had the opportunity to better themselves by obtaining high-paying jobs, but they were still not as powerful as the emperor. Artisans are next. Artisans were highly respected and often spent time with Nobles. Below that are the peasants. The peasants were often abused by the government. The Qing Dynasty practiced slavery. The slaves would serve the household and it was seen as a status symbol. if the family was rich, then even the slaves would have slaves. (Qing Dynasty Social Structure). Here is a list of all the emperors of the Qing Dynasty (Europeans please note that there are no Shunzhi XXVIII or Jiaqing V as the Qing Dynasty emperors were more creative when naming their children!): Shunzhi Emperor 1644 –1661, Kangxi Emperor 1662 –1722, Yongzheng Emperor 1723 –1735, Qianlong Emperor 1736 –1795, Jiaqing Emperor 1796 –1820, Daoguang Emperor 1821–1850, Xianfeng Emperor 1851–1861, Tongzhi Emperor 1862–1874, Guangxu Emperor 1875–1908, and Xuantong Emperor 1909–1911. (List of Qing Emperors 1644-1911). The Kangxi Emperor is considered. the most important emperor of the Qing Dynasty. He was only eight when he became emperor. Once Kangxi became emperor he hired native Chinese scholars to be a part of the court. This led to the new government gaining the support of the educated elite and China's population. Additionally, it was part of Kangxi's quest to transform the government into a Confucian one. Furthermore, he was able to stop multiple rebellions and gain control of the country. Toward the end of his rule, he focused on making the country financially stable. Kangxi took a tour of the southern part of China. He then commissioned scrolls to be made depicting his trip. They were called the "Southern Inspection Tour." The Qianlong Emperor continued his Grand Fathers legacy (Kangxi) and made the country very prosperous. He continued the tours of the country and took multiple trips to South China. With those tours, he commissioned more scrolls depicting the journey. Under his rule, the Qing Dynasty grew in size tremendously. This growth led to a socio-political issue of being a multi-ethnic country. Because of this, the Dynasty had a lot of religious and political tolerance. Finally, the emperor commissioned a great amount of art. (Hearn and Zelin).  
  
## Women's rights  
  
During the early Qing Dynasty, women were an important part of society. They were still seen as less than men, but they were able to run inns, read sutras and religious texts, and were able to read and write. Unfortunately, widow chastity was increasingly popular. If a widow had no children they would often commit suicide. If a woman’s fiance died before they were married, she would often move into her fiance's home and serve his family. As time went on more women were able to read, and some even published poetry. Towards the twentieth century, traditional family systems and the oppression of women were changed, and, like most of the world, gained more rights and freedom. We advise all women who travel to the Qing Dynasty to not be afraid of being oppressed as the country was very liberal for the period. (Ebrey).  
  
## Sights of interest  
  
Many sites are very interesting! We think that they are the best in the world. The most important site in the dynasty is the Imperial Tombs. The Tombs contain the bodies of multiple Qing Dynasty emperors. The tombs are spread throughout the eastern region of the Qing Dynasty. The tombs are laid out in specific ways that follow the Chinese hierarchal rules. They are beautifully made, and we think that they are the best in the world (don’t tell Egypt!). (Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties). Furthermore, the Forbidden City in the center of Beijing was a building built to be the imperial palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. This palace could rival  The city is called city because it contains 9,999 buildings surrounded by a moat and a wall. Built from 1407-1420, it took over a million workers and 100,000 artisans to build the structure. The bricks are made from egg whites and rice which makes it extremely strong. The city has two sections. The first section is called the outer court in the south where the emperor would make legal decisions, while in the north, the inner court is for the emperor's family. (The Forbidden City). Finally, one of the most famous sites of the Qing Dynasty is the Great Wall of China. Built-in 220 B.C.E., emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have initiated the building of the wall. The wall was continually built up throughout the centuries. When the Qing took over their empire stretched beyond the limits of the wall. So it took up a more symbolic identity, like the pyramids (yes we are picking on Egypt in this section). (The Great Wall of China).  
  
There are so many sites that you can visit here. We promise that you will never be bored when you visit the Qing Dynasty.

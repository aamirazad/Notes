# Tg - Yi dynasty

(1392-1910)

## Geography and climate

Located on the Korean peninsula, the Yi Dynasty is home to a hilly biome surrounded by numerous mountains: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Namsan, Naksan, Bukhansan, Deogyangsan, Gwanaksan, and Yongmasan. Since many people live in these mountains, there isn't very much farming. Therefore, "the farmhouses … located on the hilly uplands so as not to take up valuable farmland" (Vernacular  n.pag.). It's unfortunate that there is little room to grow crops because the weather conditions are ideal for farming, with fairly warm temperatures year round and lots of rain. We have all four seasons, with January being the coldest month with an average of 26 degrees Fahrenheit, and August being the warmest, obtaining an average of 76 degrees Fahrenheit. Furthermore, due to the East Asian Monsoon, summers are hot and humid, and winters are dry and humid. This weather makes it the perfect place to visit year round especially if you're looking for a warm vacation with lots of history.

Since the people of the Yi Dynasty can't produce very many crops, and they are surrounded by the East and Yellow Sea, most of our food comes from the ocean. This means that they ate lots of fish, which can be seen in Korea today. Also, there are many ships to allowpassage through the seas for trade.

One of Yi Seong-Gye’s first acts as emperor was to move the capital of the Yi Dynasty from Songdo to Hanyang, present day Seoul. This new capital would allow trade to flourish as it was centered in the Korean Peninsula where the Hangang River flowed through to the Yellow Sea (History  n.pag.).

## Religion

While visiting South Korea, you may notice that not many attend religious services. That’s because about fifty percent of the current population does not identify with a specific religion. They attend random services here and there, but don’t devote themselves to it. Over the years, however, numerous religions have been heavily forced.

When Yi-Song Gye founded the Yi Dynasty, an empire that inhabited the Korean peninsula from 1392-1910, he instantly converted his people to Confucianism. At the time, Buddhism was the main religion and there had been numerous expensive temples and monasteries built to worship in. Some were destroyed after the conversion to Buddhism, but since they lived in the mountains, some were hard to destroy or even find. This allowed for some monks to be able to continue practicing their faith, even though the Confucian nobles and scholars highly disagreed. The main difference between the two religions is that in Buddhism, “Buddhists believe that the human life is one of suffering, and that meditation, spiritual and physical labor, and good behavior are the ways to achieve enlightenment, or nirvana”(Society  n.pag.), and in contrast, Confucianism was the belief that virtues must be influenced and elders must be worshiped. The Yi incorporated Confucianism into their education system, ceremonies, and administration.

About 20,000 temples exist today that you can visit. Some of these more well-known temples include the Manggyeongsa, Taeansa, Naejangsa, Daejeonsa, and Cheongpyeongsa.

## Brief history

The Yi Dynasty was founded in 1392 after General Yi Seong-Gye had overthrown the Goryeo Dynasty due to political turmoil, arguments amongst nobility, and pirates. Once Seong-Gye had claimed the Goryeo, he renamed it the Joseon Empire. It’s also known as the Yi Dynasty after his last name.

His first act as King Taejo of Joseon, was to move the capitol to Hanyang, present day Seoul, seeing as it fit the standards of feng shui. He also ordered the making of the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Jongmyo shrine(Joseon  n.pag.). Both of these locations still exist to this day and can be visited on your tour. Another one of the first things he did was try to repair relations with Ming China, which he was successful at. After that, the another major change he made was to convert his people to Confucianism. He then died during a conflict between his two sons in 1408.

The next significant event happened in 1592 when the first wave of the Japanese Invasion of Korea occurred. Known as the Imjin War, this conflict lasted for six years, and the Joseon reigned victorious due to their relationship with the Ming and their elite naval force. This would be known as the largest sea invasion until World War II.

Only 35 years later in 1627, The Jin launched an invasion on the Joseon Kingdom. “The invasion culminated in a peace agreement on Ganghwa Island, marking a significant shift in the regional power dynamic. The terms of the treaty required Joseon to abandon the Ming era name Tianqi and offer hostages, while promising non-violation of territories between Jin and Joseon” (Joseon  n.pag.). As a result, they had to discreetly engage in relations with the Ming, their economy crashed, and had to surrender the Warka Tribe. It also set up the battlefield for the second Manchu Invasion to occur in 1636. This event would permanently shatter their relationship with the Ming, and they would become a completely independent company until they made the Treaty of Ganghwa with Japan in 1876 which would eventually lead the Yi Dynasty to its demise in 1910. Most of the culture you’ll see today when you visit is a mix of the old Yi Dynasty and the Japan empire, who eventually pillaged them and claimed their land.

## Economy

Towards the beginning of the Yi Dynasty, the government began to require taxes in order to help build their small economy. Gongmin, the taxpayers, were people who were typically in the middle class. Since there was only so much money you could gather from one class, "… there were three main categories of taxes in Joseon, the so-called jo-yong-jo system: the land tax (jo), statute labor (yong), and the household tax (jo; paid in locally produced goods)" (Tax  n.pag.). Therefore, taxes worked very differently seeing as there were fewer of them, and they only applied to the middle class (how unfair).

Throughout the rise of the Yi Dynasty, they engaged in much trade with the Ming Dynasty, as they were their only main ally. They benefited greatly from this trade, and therefore, the economy was relatively stable. They also participated in bilateral trade with Japan, the clan of Tsusshima Island, Ryukyu, Siam, and Java. Even though they had a steady flow of taxes and successful trading partners, the economy was relatively small. In 1592 when the Imjin War occurred, they lost lots of money and had to tax lots more products to regain the money they lost. The economy continued to build until the many conflicts that began to occur in the 1800s with the French, Japanese, and Americans. It was also around this time that they lost complete trade with the Ming Dynasty and had to begin to trade with Japan, who eventually came to rule them.

## Alliances and conflicts

The Joseon Dynasty's neighboring Empire, the Ming Dynasty, was the Yi Dynasty's closest alliance and partner, engaging in many cultural activities together and exchanging royal envoys every year. These two countries stayed loyal to each other until the Ming Dynasty was captured and made the Qing Dynasty after the Second Invasion of Manchu.

The Yi Dynasty's only other major alliance was with Japan. During the 1300 and 1400s, Japan and the Choson Dynasty exchanged in fair bilateral trade, until the Japanese declared a larger share of the trade in the 1500s. The Joseon disagreed, and as a result, "The Japanese threw the Joseon society into turmoil by causing disturbances: the Disturbance of the Three Ports, also known as Sampo Waeran, in 1510 and Eulmyo Waebyeon (Japanese pirates’ disturbance) in 1555" (Joseon  n.pag.). Japan spent the next eighty-two years uniting themselves to be able to begin the Imjin War in 1592. This war lasted for seven years, and the Yi reigned victorious thanks to their alliance with the Ming. It would remain tense for the next 300 years, but no action would be taken until the first Sino-Japanese War beginning in 1894. The war resulted in the fall of Qing China and Japan taking gradual control over Joseon. These events that took place during the fall of the Yi took place during the World Wars.

## Traditions

### Birth

There were many traditions involving birth in the Joseon Dynasty. One of the first traditions is to pray to Samsin, the goddess of childbirth, that their child was a boy to carry on the family name. Obviously, values have changed, and today, people don't have that much of a preference. Next, after the birth the family hangs straw by the door to keep evil spirits away, and the baby would be put in his or her first set of clothes called a baenaetjeogor. Then the umbilical cord would either be buried or kept in a pot to wish the baby a long, happy, healthy life. The last tradition surrounding birth is the babies doll during their first birthday, where he or she would pick up an object placed on a table to predict his or her fate and lifespan. These traditions are obviously very different from today's gender reveal or baby shower.

### Coming of age ceremony

If you're reading this, you're probably eighteen or older, so you're an adult. When you turned eighteen, you were probably thrown a birthday party and that was it. For the people of the Joseon Dynasty, however, it was very different. When men turned twenty, through a ceremony called Gwallye, they were allowed to tie their hair back for the first time and wear a hat made from horsehair. For the girls, when they turned fifteen (notice the age difference), they went through a ceremony called Gyere where they went from holding their hair in a braid, to a bun. These traditions were an important part of culture, and were both the traditional hairstyle for the married. It also symbolized that the child was now an adult.

### Marriage

Unlike today, marriage was a traditional and crucial part of one's life. Marriages were arranged, and "when two families agreed to the marriage of their children, the bridegroom's family sent a letter of betrothal and a box of bridal gifts to the bride's family" (Life  n.pag.). Then furthermore, on the wedding day, the groom would give the bride a goose sculpted from wood which would symbolize his eternal faith. Lastly, they would drink from the same cup. The ceremony was nowhere near as fun or unique as a wedding ceremony today.

## Art and culture

About halfway through the time of the Joseon, music, dance, and culture began to bloom. Artworks dealing with screen paintings, calligraphy, and ceramics started to arise. Many of these pieces depicted landscapes or Confucianism ceremonies. In terms of dance, many folk dances were invented, and for royals, Jeongjae was their classic dance. Next, many scholars enjoyed nature, writing, and music specifically played by a zither, Geomungo, or Pansori. There are many performances and classes that can be taken to have the privilege of listening or watching these art forms. If you're looking for rap music, however, you're out of luck.

In their culture, due to their Confucianism belief, family was incredibly important. Women had the traditional roles of caring for the home and children, while men were the head of the household and did all the work. Once the children reached the age of becoming an adult, for women it was 15 and for men it was 20, they were expected to take their places in the real world. For men, they needed to get a job, and "pass the state exams and become a government official" (New  n.pag.). For women, they were married off and began their new positions.

Lastly, another important part of their culture was their Confucianism belief. Due to this set faith, they had many rituals in their culture revolved around death. When a loved one was lost, they would be buried with important items that they would need in the afterlife. A funeral ceremony called a jesa would be held, and the family would remain in mourning for the next three years.

## Government

The Joseon were run by the yangban who were at the top of the top of the feudal system. They were split into two groups that included the military branch and civil branch. Being the highest class, they received many privileges like being able to receive a higher education (Joseon  n.pag.). The next class down was the sangmin who were the commoners, and they had the best chance of moving up the pyramid. They paid taxes, made up eighty percent of the society, and had jobs such as merchants, artisans, and fishermen. Furthermore, there were the jungjin people who worked jobs like interpreters, astronomers, and accountants. Lastly, there were the cheonmin who were the peasants. They worked primarily on farms.

Throughout the years, the Yi had many powerful emperors and military leaders. Here's a brief overview of the most important ones -

General Yi Song-Gye: Song-Gye is known for overthrowing the Goryeo, finding the Yi Dynasty, and laying down the rules for the empire.

Sejong the Great: Being the fourth monarch of the Joseon Dynasty, he was known for creating the Korean alphabet, promoting Confucianism, creating a loan system for farmers, opening up relief centers in times of need, promoting music, linguistics, philosophy, and science, giving government support to people for education, sponsoring scientific inventions, and creating a type of movable metal.

Kojong: Kojong became the king while he was only a boy and was forced to rule during the fall of the Dynasty. He put up a noble fight, but was killed by the Japanese by being poisoned.

## Women’s Rights

If you're looking back through time periods and thinking about which one you would love to live in, it's not this one if you're a woman. Women had the typical feminine role in society, where they were in charge of having children and tending to the home. These strict rules were thanks to their dedication to Confucianism. Girls belonged to their fathers until marriage, where at that point, they belonged to their husbands. "Confucius's teachings also set forth the "seven evils" (chilgo Chiak) justifying the expulsion of a wife from the household: disobeying parents-in-law, bearing no son, committing adultery, jealousy, carrying a hereditary disease, garrulousness, and larceny" (Abstract  n.pag.). Therefore, almost everything that went wrong was a women's fault.

## Sites of interest

The Gyeongbokgung Palace was built in 1394 by King Taejo as the first and largest palace built during the Joseon Dynasty. The palace has stunning gardens and demonstrates classic Korea architecture through its pavilions. Located in Seoul, it only costs $2.30 to tour, and it is highly recommended for all lovers of nature and history.

In 1394, the Jongmyo Shrine was built as a place for royalty to worship their ancestors and participate in Confucian rites. During the Japanese invasion, the shrine was destroyed, but seeing as what an important piece of history it is, it was rebuilt relatively quickly. This shrine is also located in Seoul, so you could visit the shrine and palace on the same day.

Situated on the Taebak mountain, the Manggyeongsa Temple was built as a place for Buddhist to worship. This temple is sure to provide much beauty and stunning views, as the Taebak mountain is one of the tallest in Korea.

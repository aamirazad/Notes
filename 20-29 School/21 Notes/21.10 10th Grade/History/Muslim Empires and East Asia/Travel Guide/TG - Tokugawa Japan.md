# Tg - Tokugawa Japan

1603-1867

## Geography and climate

Japan is an archipelago located on the Eastern coast of Asia. The country is mostly made up of mountains. Most of the mountains are volcanic, so if you are visiting, pray that it doesn't erupt! (Petry). The country also lies on three tectonic plates. These cause a lot of earthquakes (Japan). Japan has multiple rivers as well. The largest is the Shinano River. It is used for drinking water and transport. The most important river is the Tone River. This river runs through the center of the country and supplies a large amount of people with drinking water and food. The water current is very strong, so don't swim in this river! (The Best Known Rivers in Japan). Japan has little resources. There is a little supply of iron and coal. The sea is a big part of Japanese society. Japan harvests and eats a lot of seafood.  There are not a lot of places to farm, so many do not take part in agriculture (Petry). Also, the Climate varies throughout the year with warm summers and cold winters. Towards the southern islands, you can get more tropical climates that have humid summers and less harsh winters. We recommend these islands for all of our Northern Europeans. We know how cold it gets up there! (General Information on Climate of Japan).

## Religion

In Tokugawa, there were three main religions that the society practiced. These are Neo-Confucianism, Shinto, and Buddhism. Christianity was also present in the country, but Christians were highly persecuted. If you want to travel to Japan, we recommend that you are not Christian or you lie about your religion. (Religion in Tokugawa Japan). 

Neo-Confucianism was a vital part of Japan. Ieyusa, the first Shogun of Japan, liked the religion and it eventually became a way to legitimize the country's social hierarchy. Neo-Confucianism is different than Confucianism because Neo-Confucianism has a required system of reciprocal relationships. Japan used this to validate their social order by explaining that there was a more complex reason why an emperor was more important than a subject. This was also used in families where the Husband was dominant over his wife. Furthermore, Neo-Confucianism believes that everything in life is supposed to be simple. There is also an invisible force that can make life complicated. The goal of this religion is to get beyond this invisible force and find simplicity in life. That sounds pretty simple! (Religion in Tokugawa Japan). 

Shinto is the only native religion that is practiced in Japan. No one is certain where Shinto started. Shinto is a faith dedicated to worshiping nature, cleanliness, fertility, and certain natural occurrences like typhoons. Many villages had their own shrines. These were used for dealing with spiritual purification and entertainment. People who follow Shinto do follow a God or Gods. There is no clear sign whether they worship one God or multiple. We do know that the God(s) wanted people to be clean in their body and soul. (Religion in Tokugawa Japan). 

Buddhism was very popular during the time. The Shogun Ieyasu even ordered every citizen of the country to register in a Buddhist temple. Japan practiced three types of Buddhism, Zen, Nichiren, and Jodo. Zen was most popular among the Samurai. This distinguished the lower class from the higher class as many did not have time to meditate, a key practice in Zen Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism was a more doctrine sect of the religion. These Buddhists followed sermons from the Buddha and believed that any other form of Buddhism was harmful. They also believed in going to teachers, scholars, and the government for help during times of need, which contributed to Japan's philosophy of reciprocal relationships. Jodo Buddhism was the most important as many farmers could participate in the religion. Judo had Christian values such as the ability for poor people to gain eternal bliss. This was attractive to most peasants because they didn't have to contribute time to meditate or money to a temple to gain this bliss. (Religion in Tokugawa Japan). 

Christianity was not followed by many people. Most Christians in Japan were influenced by the Jesuits who made pilgrimages there. (Religion in Tokugawa Japan).

## History

The Tokugawa Era started in 1600 when Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s army in the Battle of  Sekigahara. (Tokugawa Period (1603 – 1868)). Toyotomi was the previous ruler of Japan. He began his life as a farmer, then a castle designer, and later began leading the country and defeating many clans who went against him. (Toyotomi Hideyoshi a Unifier of Japan). In 1603, after Toyotomi died, and the imperial court had discussed, they gave the title of Shogun to Ieyasu. He then moved the capital to Edo, where he had built a castle. In 1615 he defeated all of the clans in Japan which made him powerful. This is the beginning of a 300-century rule. This period was generally very peaceful and prosperous. (Tokugawa Period (1603 – 1868)).

Ieyasu's first decision was to cut off all imports to Japan except for the Dutch. He also deported many European missionaries from the country. (Tokugawa Period (1603 – 1868)) 

Lots of art and literature were created during this time. 

In 1854 the United States demanded that the Japanese trade with them. This led to lots of Western medicine, ideas, history, and philosophy entering Japan, and books on those topics were translated into Japanese. (Tokugawa Period (1603 – 1868)). 

Eventually, two strong clans, who hated the Tokugawa, came together to take over Japan. This led to an "Imperial Restoration," and rapid modernization. (Meiji Restoration).

## Economy

Even though there was not a lot of space to farm, agriculture and rice were major parts of Japan's economy. Since Japan was very isolated, trade was not a big factor in Japan. The Emperor made most of his income from rice taxes, monopolies on mining, foreign trade, and minting money, direct control of major cities, financial contributions from merchants in exchange for monopoly over certain items, and charges on borrowing from rich merchants. (Edo Period).  

Rice was a huge part of the economy. Samurai were even paid for rice. Usually, one would receive rice and then exchange it for money. The money used was mostly made of gold, silver, or copper. (Edo Period). 

Free movement of people and merchandise was not supported for military concerns. Cash crops and advanced farming systems also increased the economy. (Edo Period). 

Furthermore, the government tried to tax private businesses, but they mostly embraced a free economy. (Edo Period). 

If you are a trader we do not recommend coming to Japan. If you love rice and farming then this is the best place for you!

## Alliances and conflicts

Tokugawa Japan did not have a lot of Alliances as the country was very isolated and scared of foreigners. The country did have a trade alliance with the Dutch. The Dutch were the only ones allowed to trade with Japan. Towards the end of the empire, they also traded with the United States. (Tokugawa Period (1603-1868)). 

Japan did not have many conflicts as they were a very peaceful empire. The first conflict was when an American warship entered Japanese waters and demanded that they open up trading with the United States or they would be invaded. Furthermore, the Boshin War, or the Japanese Civil War was a monumental war that led to the demise of the Tokugawa army. This rebellion was caused by two anti-Tokugawa clans who fought the Tokugawa army. 

Japan does not have a very large military history, so if you love military history Japan may not be the best place for you. We recommend you look at other countries "Conflict" sections for more information.

## Traditions/Customs

The Tokugawa empire's social class was very traditional. People were expected to stay in their class and do their best in said class (more on social class in the government section). Education was also very important during the time.  Samurai were expected to go to school and with that learn martial arts and literature. Not only Samurai were supposed to get educated and many schools were set up throughout the country. Most education was based on your social class and practical skills. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?). 

Confucianism was also very important. Many practiced Filial Piety or the worshipping of Ancestors. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?). 

The Tokugawa Empire also valued helping others. Fire Stations were set up to end fire, which were very common. Furthermore, several welfare programs were set up to support poor families. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?).

Tokugawa does not have many traditions, but they are very good ones. After your trip, you should recommend some of these practices to your country, for Japan was very ahead of its time. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?).

## Art and culture

The Tokugawa Era brought bright urban life. Many people's lives revolved around cities. This was especially important for merchants who sold goods in cities. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?). 

Citizens usually wore a Kimono. These can be in a variety of styles depending on your age, gender, and social class. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?). 

Food in Japan was very ocean-oriented. Sushi, tempura, and soba were very common. Tea had a more ceremonial essence and was widely practiced. (What was life like in Edo Period Japan?). 

Art was mostly made by artisans and merchants. Since the Dutch were able to trade with Japan, porcelain was created because it was highly sought after in Europe. (Art of the Edo Period (1615–1868)). 

Paintings often depicted peaceful daily life or an exuberant festival. Art in urban areas would include tourist destinations or scenes of nature. (The Art of Observation in the Edo Period (1600–1868)). 

Woodblock Prints were used in a more economic sense. Woodblock prints would depict romantic vistas and actors. These prints would be made in large quantities and sold to wealthy merchants. There was a publisher who would commission wood prints, hoping to make a profit. Woodblock Prints were famous all over the world. (Woodblock Prints in the Ukiyo-e Style). 

Poetry was popular during the Tokugawa period. One of the most important poets and Haiku masters was Matsuo Basho. Basho studied multiple religions including Taoism and Zen Buddhism. His poetry was often influenced by these religions. He wrote Narrow Road to the Interior, Travelogue of Weather-Beaten Bones, The Knapsack Notebook, and Sarashina Travelogue. He also took a 1,200-mile walk. He walked with his disciple Sora. On the trip, he would write and discuss with different people he met on his trip. This trip influenced his book Narrow Road to the Interior. (Bashō). 

Art is very important in Japanese society, and any tourist interested in art should definitely visit a city because art flourished there.

## Government and leaders

The Tokugawa government was very complicated. Called the Bukuhan System, it is a collection of different fiefs with different governments in each. The most important fief and the leader of Japan was the Tokugawa Shogunate. They collected taxes, controlled samurai and cities, maintained civil order, encouraged commerce, and defended their fief. The Tokugawa took part in the imperial court, the imperial nobility, and the emperor. The Shogunate had multiple monopolies over the imperial court, trade, and foreign relations. The Tokugawas had a police and spy system as well. Most importantly, the Tokugawas controlled the domains of ancient Japan's ruling class. These domains, whose leaders were called Daimyos, were heavily regulated. The Tokugawa government could reduce the size of the domain, force the leader to give up control of the domain, or even tell the leader to commit suicide. The most effective way to control the Daimyos was to make them have to live in Edo. They also used a hostage system where the Daimyos' families were kept in Edo even if the Daimyo had to leave Edo. (Tokugawa Political System). 

The political order of Japan was highly rigid, with not many opportunities to go up in class. The highest class was the emperor, then the samurai, farmer, artisan, and finally merchant. The Emperor was the head of the government and the most important person in Japan. Samurai were mostly used to stop peasant revolts and for national security in general. The Samurai followed a "Code of Bushido." The code of Bushido has eight rules, rectitude or justice, courage, benevolence or mercy, politeness,  honesty and sincerity, honor, loyalty,  and character and self-control. (Clark). Farmers were considered highly important as they supplied the nation with food. Artisans were also cherished as they built things. Merchants were not valued in society because they did not contribute at all to society. (M. Elshaikh). 

Here is a list of all the emperors of Tokugawa: 

Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542-1616), ruled from 1603 to 1605. Tokugawa Hidetada (1579-1632), ruled from 1605 to 1623. Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604-1651), ruled from 1623 to 1651. Tokugawa Ietsuna (1641-1680), ruled from 1651 to 1680. Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1646-1709), ruled from 1680 to 1709. Tokugawa Ienobu (1662-1712), ruled from 1709 to 1712. Tokugawa Ietsugu (1709-1716), ruled from 1713 to 1716. Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684-1751), ruled from 1716 to 1745. Tokugawa Ieshige (1711-1761), ruled from 1745 to 1760. Tokugawa Ieharu (1737-1786), ruled from 1760 to 1786. Tokugawa Ienari (1773-1841), ruled from 1787 to 1837. Tokugawa Ieyoshi (1793-1858), ruled from 1837 to 1853. Tokugawa Iesada (1824-1858), ruled from 1853 to 1858. Tokugawa Iemochi (1846-1866), ruled from 1858 to 1866. Tokugawa Yoshinobu (1837-1913), ruled from 1867 to 1868. (The Tokugawa Shoguns - from Tokugawa Ieyasu to Yoshinobu). 

Tokugawa Ieyasu was the most important Tokugawa as he started the Tokugawa empire. He was the son of a small Daimyo. later in life, he led his army and its allies to conquer Japan. After taking over Japan he led the country into prosperity while outliving all of his enemies. (Tokugawa Ieyasu). 

Oda Nobunaga was another important figure. He was a Daimyo, whose father was also a warlord. Once he took over his father's kingdom he had to fight a lot of enemies including his own family. When he visited Kyoto he partnered with Ieyasu. He eventually started taking over other Daimyos and gained strong vassals such as Toyotomi. After many years of war, he almost unified the country. Unfortunately, anti-Nobunaga movements started and he was eventually defeated. (Oda Nobunaga a Unifier of Japan). 

Tokugawa government is complicated. We suggest being extra careful when traveling through Japan, just to make sure you don't break any laws.

## Women’s Rights

Women's Rights were very Traditional in Tokugawa Japan. Women were not educated as much as men. Around 10% of women were educated. They were only allowed to learn Hiragana, a writing system in the Japanese language, so they could not read political texts. (Edo Period). 

Women were seen as lower than men. They were expected to serve their husband and not "get in the way" of their endeavors. Tokugawa government allowed men to even kill their wives if they were lazy. Even the wives of Samurai had limited rights. (Edo Period). 

The responsibilities of women were to: serve their husbands, become entertainers, take care of their children, and be housemaids.  (Edo Period). 

Tokugawa was very modern economically, but it had very traditional values when it came to women's rights. We do not think you should base whether you go on the trip to Japan or not just because of this information. Japan has so much more to offer. This is also an opportunity for you to voice your opinion and make a change.

## Sites of interest

Tokugawa has a lot of nice sightseeing opportunities. Hopefully, your horse and carriage can make the trip to see them all! 

In the North, there is the Kawagoe Castle. This castle was important as it protected the northern side of the capital and was a trade city. This castle was often inhabited by a lord who was a close ally of the Tokugawa. (Honmaru Goten (Kawagoe Castle)). 

Next, there is the Toshogu Shrine. This shrine is full of lavish structures and is surrounded by a dense forest. This shrine is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu. (Tokugawa Ieshige and Must-Visit Places Related to the Tokugawa Shogunate).

Finally, the Kunozan Toshogu Shrine is on the coast of Suruga Bay. This shrine was dedicated to Ieyasu for his efforts to end the civil war. (Tokugawa Ieshige and Must-Visit Places Related to the Tokugawa Shogunate).  

There is so much more the country has to offer. We recommend visiting some of the shrines that are spread all throughout the country.

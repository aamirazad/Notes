# Tg - Mogul empire

1526–1857

## Geography and climate

Controlling over four million square kilometers of land, the Mogul Empire is massive (Szczepanski). The Mogul Empire is located in modern day India and Pakistan. It is beautiful, full of mountains and rivers. The most popular place to see is the Taj Mahal. Make sure you bring a lot of water, though, it can get to over one hundred degrees! The tropical climate is fertile, and the urban cities are full of people. Due to its location, the Mogul Empire made use of the precious minerals located on their land. On the land, there was a lot of farmable land and along the coast, they farmed for seafood. As you walk around, you'll notice because of the source of food, many unique foods have been made like fish cutlets. this Providing water to the land is two big rivers, the Ganges and the Indus River valley. These rivers split the empire somewhat. (Lodrick and Ahmad).

## Religion

The Mogul Empire is one of the three biggest powers in the Islamic world, alongside the [[TG - Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]] and the [[./TG - Safavid Dynasty|Safavid Dynasty]] (Szczepanski). Although it was mainly Islamic, Akbar followed Babur's initiative to make it more fair for everyone. One of these actions was when he removed a tax called the Jizyah. This tax was hated among non-Muslims, as they had to pay the emperor just for being non-Muslim. Akbar also created a policy that gave equality no matter their region. This helps the other religions present in the Mogul Empire such as Hindu, Persian, and Christian to get more attention. Along with a large Hindu population, Persian art and culture contributes to making the empire more diverse and beautiful. But religion wasn't pushed too hard in society either, the art and buildings were not overly religious. This could help you feel more welcomed and included. This created stability, which contributed to the Empire's long-lasting rule. Even though there were some emperors that did not keep as much religious tolerance, overall, the place is very tolerant to other religions compared to the other options.

## History

An important thing you should know if you decide to go to the Mogal Empire, is the history of how it started. One of the many descendants of the great Mongol leader Genghis Khan, a young prince Babur at only age twelve founded the Mogul Empire. This is where the name "Mogul" comes from. (Mongol, Mogal). Military warfare created the empire when Babur won the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 using twenty cannons to destroy an army much bigger than his. (Howarth). Empires that gain their dominance because of having early adoption of the gun are called gunpowder empires

After Babur died shortly after, his son Humayan took his place, but poorly. Preferring poetry and books, Humayan was not very war competent. Ironically, he died by falling down the stairs in front of his library. But it was only with Babur's grandson, Akbar, in 1556, that the Mogul Empire really took off. Using trade of textiles and other precious goods to become rich and also creating a well designed government system, Akbar grew the empire to greatly (as shown in the picture) almost completely covering modern-day India. This is also due to his military competence, which Babur's son did not have. Akbar created many schools and colleges, wanting everyone to have the opportunity to get an education. This is great for you if you are trying to become a expert in your field!

Jahangir and Shah Jahan followed, continuing the Mogul Empire's domience. Jahangir ruled from 1605 to 1627, keeping the place peaceful and strong. After leaving his earlier wife, his niece Mumtaz Mahal, he married Nur Jahan, a widowed woman who was known for helping rule at the throne. (“Nur Jahan”). But when Mumtaz Mahal, died after giving birth to their 14th child, Shah Jahan built the now famous Taj Mahal as her tomb. Shah Jahan was also known for being a very good emperor and continuing the empire's 'golden era' it was going through. Later, Aurangzeb's rule would be known as the last of the great Mughal emperors of India. (Honchell Smith).

## Economy

The Mogul economy is mainly dependent by trade and farming. But the structure is very complicated at the top. The emperors become rich because of the ruling elites. They give the emperors power while still having a lot of power over them. The nobles, the landowning class, are also made up of zamindars who are a large landowner with a full ownership of the land. The imperial court is made up of accountants, secretaries, officers and more who help the Emperor with managing the country. The elites follow a mansabdari system, which was created by Genghis Khan to classify the nobility. (Szczepanski). Under this, the emperor controls a lot of the noble's lives such as their education, and who they married. The farmers and artisans make the money for the empire, while the upper class makes money by taxation. Using the farming materials, hand-loom textiles are sold in mass to the Indian Ocean economy. Since cotton and silk are in such demand, India is very rich, attracting trade from even China and Persia. Along with the nobles who serve the emperor, vassals are also on the top of the pyramid.

## Alliance and conflicts

For a very long time, Moguls were allies of Pashtun, but much later, after a three year revolt, Pashtun took a large chunk of the Mogul's land. The Moguls is also in full alliance with the Ottoman Empire, who is another large Muslim empire. Their empire was very similar to the Moguls in that the empire was peaceful as long as the people in it paid their taxes and followed the law. The Moguls were also peaceful with the Safavids. These three empires in the trifecta had different strengths. The Ottoman was strong military wise, while the Safavid dynasty was strong culturally, and the Mogul had a strong economic power. But since all three of these Muslim states had commonalities, there was some fighting, such as who was the protector of the two Muslim sacred cities Mecca and Medina. (Blake).

## Traditions

The Mogul Empire is a very nice place to be! Get ready to get immersed in it's rich, diverse culture with its panting and art. The Mogul gardens found everywhere are well known and very unique to the others, its a great place to relax. You will be surrounded by sweet smelling plants and beautiful flowers. These traditions come from the place India was before the Mogul Empire was created, Kashmir (Centre). In addition, education was valued mostly thanks to Akbar. Because of this, many lower class can have a good life for themselves thanks to the good education.

## Art and culture

The Mogul Empire had lots of diverse art and culture. This melting pot also makes the cuisine to have a very different look compared to others. Big dishes like biryani and kebabs is very popular and attracts many tourists like you! Akbar was a big proponent of furthering the empire's knowledge and art. He helped painters and calligraphers flourish. Within a workshop, many different artists collaborate to create, sometimes hiring more advanced artists to finish their project, bringing their own culture into the project. Akbar's first book, Tutinama, was about a parrot with her wife. The art of the parrot has a distinct brush style which makes it unique. Most Mogul paintings are illustration for a book or of individuals. There was not much religion in these images. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia).

## Government

The Mogul Empire's political system was a monarchy. But there are a few differences, the big one being that any of the sons of the emperor are eligible to take the throne. Each son was independent and worked to gain the right to the throne. As they slowly develop wealth by owning territory, they move up, and when it's time for the next emperor to be chosen, battles usually strike out to determine the true winner. Because both the government was well designed, and both Hindu and Muslim were allowed to be emperor, few issues comes out of this government which makes for a very stable empire. Using their large wealth from cotton and silk, the government was secure from rebellions and other empires with their very strong military.

## Women’s Rights

The fairness for woman in the Mogul empire is quite good. Women and men shared daily chores like make good and setting up a good living environment with men. Woman also have a lot of rights compared to other places, woman in some cases are allowed to own and inherit property and be involved with society in a significant way. Some women even acted as emperor for a short period of time before a permanent emperor could be found. Woman such as Alan Goa, and Hoelun were known for being very independent and still accomplish a lot. Hoelun was Genghis Khan's mother who taught him to rebel. She is taught as a great person for being courageous. (Cartwright)

# Tg - Ming dynasty

1368 - 1644

## Geography and climate

The Ming Dynasty took place in China from the late 14th century until the mid 17th century.  It stretched far and wide across China, occupying a lot of southeastern China plus stretching north.  The dynasty covered what would be modern-day Beijing, Shanghai, and Yangshuo.

The climate throughout most of the dynasty was relatively moderate.  Towards the end, though, for around the last century, the climate deterioration resulted in a 20-50% reduction of raw grain productions.  This caused a food crisis and several vulnerability issue for the dynasty.  (Zheng et al.)

## Religion

Religion played an important role in Ming China.  The main religion during this period of time was mostly Buddhism,.  However, the Mings believed in a set of philosophical and social teachings called Confucianism.  Developed by Confucius, the main point was to focus on personal ethnics and having good moral character.  Rulers in the Ming dynasty used what is known as 'the mandate of heaven' to legitimitize their rulings.  The mandate of heaven said that the current ruler had been blessed by the gods, and that there could only ever be one ruler at a time.  Overall, religion and philosophy shaped the identity of Ming China through their faith in Confucianism, Buddhism, and the Mandate of Heaven.

## History

The Ming dynasty is regarded as one of the most stable times in ancient China.  It was known for the refurbishment of the Great Wall, amazing trade, and a well monetized economy.

The dynasty officially began in 1368 when rebel armies led by Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan and its dynasty.  He named the start of his new era,"Da Ming," which means great brightness.

The Ming dynasty was deemed over when Beijing fell to a group of rebel armies in 1644, led by Li Zicheng. (“An Introduction to the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) (Article) | Khan Academy”)

## Economy

The Ming dynasty saw the rise of plantations and an agricultural type economy.  Crops such as tea, rice, and various types of fruits.  These crops were traded and sold as cash crops.

Urban markets developed at this time period, in which crops and agricultural goods were sold to people in urban areas.  (“The Economy under the Ming Dynasty | World Civilization”)

The Ming saw the uprising of manufacturing.  Iron was produced at a much higher rate compared to other dynasties.  This was due to Ming rulers forcing labor policies on common people.  (“Ming Dynasty Economy - Facts about Ming Dynasty Trade & Production”)

## Alliances and conflicts

Ming China had very few close allies throughout Asia.  The Mings traded with Japan a lot, mostly with goods such as copper, silk, porcelain, and thread.  The Ming dynasty had little to no true European allies, but they did trade with a few nations in Europe.  (Study.com, 2023 Ming-dynasty).

The enemies of the Ming included the Mongols, and some of the Japanese pirates.  Manchu forces also invaded china from both the north and the south during this period.  Lastly, th e Ming dynasty eventually had conflicts with what became the Qing dynasty.

## Traditions

The Ming Dynasty brought with it multiple traditions, which helped to shape traditional Chinese culture throughout the rest of history.  The Mings created detailed pottery in which they would use for themselves and for trade exports.  Another thing the mings sought after was exploration.

Mings developed innovation in practices such as calligraphy, poetry, and ceramics.  The porcelain that the ming dynasty created was traditionally blue and white, and this was exported for trade to help out the economy.

## Art and culture

Ming people created art out of ivory, horn, and gold.  They created carvings, silk, and jewelry.  Mings practiced calligraphy, and artsy form of writing, as well as working with porcelain.  As mentioned before, most of the porcelain had a blue and white color scheme with designs all over it.

Paintings included pictures of birds, flowers, and phoenixes.  More colors including brown were used, as well as new techniques and skills were developed during this period.

## Government

The ming dynasty's government was considered to be an absolute monarchy.  It was ruled by a singular emperor who had all power.  Emperors forced religion and beliefs onto all citizens and would punish any who did not comply.  Each emperor had a police force that directly obeyed the emperor, this force would attempt to put down any opposition.  New emperors were hereditary, they would be the son of the existing emperor.

## Women’s Rights

During the Ming dynasty women were confined to homes and their only role was to complete household tasks.  They lived in a separate part of most homes with the children away from the men.  Women didn't have many rights, and although they were allowed to be educated, many were illiterate because women's education was not considered as important as men.

Women could not hold offices, status, or make incomes.  Marriages during this period were arranged, and if a woman's husband died she was not allowed to remarry.  The primary function of a couple was to produce a male child and raise him to be loyal to the state.

## Sites of interest

The ming dynasty did not have many important locations, but two of the most important were the capitals.  Up until 1420, the primary ming capital was Nanjing, (which translates to "southern capital") before it was moved to bejing.

# Enlightenment and Revolutions

### Path to the Enlightenment

- Movement of intellectuals who were impressed by the Scientific Revolution
- They questioned everything and tried to find reason for everything
- Especially influenced by Isaac Newton and John Locke
- Isaac Newton
  - Believed everything was a giant machine, the Newtonian world machine
  - If Newton could figure out the natural laws that governed the physical world, intellectuals could discover laws that govern human society
- John Locke
  - Wrote the _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_ he argued tabula rosa or blank min
  - Said people were molded from their experiences

### Philosophes and their ideas

- Intellectuals were known as their French name **philosophe**
- They were writers, professors, journalists
- The role of philosophe is to change the world
- Many disagreed, ideas becoming radical each generation
- Three French giants lead these people: Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Diderot
- **Montesquieu**
  - Wrote _The Spirit of Laws_ where he tried to use the scientific method to find the laws that govern social and political relationships
  - Invented the branches of government: the executive (monarch), legislative (parliament), and judicial (courts) which creates
    - The **separation of powers** so one doesn't get too powerful
    - Checks and balances (we stole all of this in our constitution)

    - Said god created the world with natural rules and allowed it to run without interference
- **Diderot**
  - He wrote Encyclopedia to change the general way of thinking
  - Attacked religious superstition supported religious toleration

### Toward a new social structure

- Modern style of economics where the buyer and the seller decide the price
  - The buyer only will buy a reasonable price, the seller will only sell a reasonable price
- The buyer only will buy a reasonable price, the seller will only sell at a reasonable price
- Laissez-faire - let people do what they want
  - **Adam Smith** advocated for this by saying the government should not interfere with economics
  - Said government should only interfere with invasion, injustice, and public goods
- As punishments for crimes, courts were made to deal with it
- But the punishments were often cruel
- Cesare Beccaia developed a new system in _On Crimes and Punishments_
  - Said punishments should be less brutal and opposed capital punishment, taking away property

### The later Enlightenment

- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** in the 1760s advocated for property rights
  - In the _Origins of the Equality of Mankind_, he said government should preserve property
  - Presented the idea of the **Social Contract**
    - The government rules by general will or, the people
    - So because the people made the laws they are less likely to break them
- Magazines, bookstores, and newsstands grew popular
  - The Ladies Mercury gave advice on marriage and children to women

### The Rights of Women

- For many years everyone thought women were inferior to men
- But in the 18th century some women expressed their ideas of more fair treatment
- **Mary Wollstonecraft** wrote _A Vindication of the Rights of Women_
  - Said a government based on arbitrary power like men having more power over women was wrong
  - Said that since the Enlightenment was all about trusting the reason of all human beings, and women could reason, women should have the same rights as men

### The Social World of the Enlightenment

- These ideas were not only coming from rich people with power, Diderot and Rousseau were from middle class
  - But the upper class had the most appeal and the common people did not care at all
- Publishing and reading books flourished in Europe
  - Books were written for the elite but also middle class and women
  - In Great Britain the first daily newspaper, _London_ was printed for very cheap and to people for free sometimes
  - **Salons** also was a hub for new ideas
    - Salons were wealth's urban houses where invited guests would discuss new ideas
    - Brought writers, artists and government officials to gather with the wealthy
    - The woman who hosed the Salon could sway opinions to gain a political advantage

### Religion in the Enlightenment

- Although many attacked the churches, lots were still Christian and during this time some tried to achieve a greater connection to god
- Protestant churches were not as popular though
- John Westly was a Anglican minister who discussed religion to the lower class

## CDW

> [!question]+ What role did the individual play in Enlightenment philosophy? How is this influenced by earlier ideas of social power and religion in Europe?
> The focus on individual rights and feeling shaped the new philosophy presented during the Enlightenment. These ideas were influenced by events like the Renaissance’s popularity of humanism. An example of the focus on the individual can be seen in the idea of Laissez-faire. Adam Smith believed the government should not interfere with people as if “individuals were free to pursue their own economic self-interest, all society would ultimately benefit.” (303). This analysis into the individual working in a society was quite new and only predated by John Locke with the idea of tabula rosa. The idea of tabula rosa, or blank mind, and Laissez-faire both use trends these philosophers were noticing. Ideas during the Enlightenment were also influenced by past events like the idea of humanism. Humanism, or the philosophy of the individual was popularized during the Renaissance and shown in the reforms that took place. This idea influenced and reinforced the Enlightenment ideas.

> [!question]+ What artistic changes occur during this era?  How are these a continuation or departure from art in other eras or empires throughout the course?
> Some of the major art changes that took place during this time were the new rococo art style as well as the musical innovations. The rococo style of art and architecture was in stark contrast to the baroque and neoclassical styles that were popular before, “Rococo made use of delicate designs colored in gold with graceful curves. The rococo style was highly secular. Its lightness and charm spoke of the pursuit of pleasure, happiness, and love.” The feeling that was shown in this style is different from the loud and rich style of baroque and neoclassical architecture. This continues the trend of a focus on human nature by trying to show the serenity of the human psyche and connection to god.

> [!question]+ What existing tensions led to the Seven Years' War?  How might this contribute to later events such as the American Revolution?
> A main reason for the Seven Years’ War is the French and Austria’s disagreement of who owned Madras. Other tensions contributed as well such as the British wanting to own more of North America. The French, after the War of the Austrian Succession, should have gone to the French but Maria Theresa of Austria rebuilt her army and fought again for the land. Another point of tension is as stated in the textbook, “On the North American continent, the French and British colonies were set up differently. French North America (Canada and Louisiana) was run by the French government as a vast trading area.” (316). This conflict of interest would cause the French and British to fight over who gets to own America, would Europe defend it’s 13 colonies or would the French expand onto it.

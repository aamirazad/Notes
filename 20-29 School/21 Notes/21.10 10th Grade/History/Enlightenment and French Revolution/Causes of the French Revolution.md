# Causes of the French Revolution

## Causes and Connections

### Food shortage

- Following a bad harvest because of the bad weather, the prices of food went up
- The commoners were affected the most as they became even less poor when they had to spend all their money on bread, the only thing they ate
- Meanwhile, the upper class would spend large amounts of money on wars and luxuries
  - An example of this was the queen, Marie Antoinette who spent large amounts of money

#### Connection to previous units

- The English Peasants Revolt during the [[Reformation Review|Reformation]] was partly caused by bad living conditions and lack of food because of unfair treatment to the commoners
- Food shortages is also more deeply connected to the monarchy's high and mighty treatment of the commoners that would cause revolts and rebellions
  - Because the monarchy has to show they are so powerful they spend lots of money that could be used better to help the commoners
  - Also, the monarchy distance themselves so much from the lower class, they don't understand what issues they are going though and how to fix them

### Estates

- Estates were the idea that in France, the people were divided into three groups of class
- The First Estate contained the clergy and had 130,000 people and owned 10 percent of the land
  - Exempt from some taxes
  - Very divided
- The Second Estates contained the nobility with 350,000 people and owning 25 percent of the land
  - Wanted to take power from the monarchy
- The Third Estate had the commoners and made up most of the population, 75 percent
  - Serfdom was removed but the concept stuck around
  - The craftspeople and such struggled due to the rise in prices and less people to buy it
  - The bourgeoisie was the middle class who were in the Third Estate
    - Owned 20 percent of the land
    - Made up of merchants, bankers

#### Connection to previous units

- Very similar to the [[Social pyramid of Europe|pyramid of feudalism]] but without serfs
  - The pyramid was never very stable and lead to destruction like the [[Rome and the Rise of Christianity#The Decline|fall of rome]]
- The separation of class caused revolutions like in [[Rome and the Rise of Christianity|rome]]
  - It can also be seen how having the monarch at the top can be bad like in florence and how their [[The Renaissance|renaissance]] created so much good because their social pyramid focused on the merchants
- The tax issue is debated during the [[Enlightenment and Revolutions|Enlightenment]]

### Estates-General

- When Estates-General took place, a group where the three estates meet to make laws, the Third Estate wanted to change the law so the first two estates had to pay taxes
  - But the first two estates had a 2-1 majority so they swore a Tennis Court Oath
  - All the people of france came together to create the National Assembly, saying they are the true government, act of rebellion
- The Tennis Court Oath was supposed to use force to stop the rebelling Third Estate members who organized themselves into a National Assembly
  - But the commoners stormed Bastille a prison removed the walls
  - Paris was left to the rebels and the royal authority gave up
- Peasant rebellions became part of the Great Fear where people worried the troops would support the monarchy forming militias

#### Connection to previous units

- This revolution is very connected to the american revolution but also hold ideas influenced by the [[Enlightenment and Revolutions|enlightenment]]
- The gathering of the common people using the printing press is very similar to [[The Reformation Part 1|The Reformation]]
  - Because of the amount of people that were able to join this revolution, they were able to overpower France's militiay

### Lack of Jobs

- The triangle of feudalism did not reward those who went above and beyond to much which meant it was hard to advance up
- The collapse of the economy also contributed to this widespread unemployment
- Social unrest also had a impact of this lack of jobs
- Overall this lack of jobs would cause the French Revolution as it people would join the revolution as they might get the ability to work a good job and make money

#### Connection to previous units

- During the [[The Black Death Review|black plague]], job shortages caused lots of civil unrest and disobedience
  - The prices of lots of goods increased because of this as well
- Without something to do or take care of, people are much more excited to run around and kill people

### Government goes to war against Austria

- In the middle of all this, the rulers of Austria and Prussia threatened to restore louis XVI to full power so the Assembly declared war on Astria
  - France did not have much success in this war, and the economy struggled
- The country was not at all organized enough to win this war

#### Connection to previous units

- After fighting the [[Enlightenment and Revolutions#Seven Years' War|Seven Years' War]] England had to fund the war somehow, this caused them to have to tax the american colonies more [[Enlightenment and Revolutions#Britain and British North America|Source]]
  - This is similar in that England lost a lot of money and people in this war which is similar to France
- People also was not happy about war which is similar to the very disruptive [[Thirty Years's War|Thirty Years's War]]

### Taxes

- Due to the war and economic collapse, taxes caused lots of people to want to revolt
- The heavy burden on the third estate made them angry, as they could not even pay for their food with inflation on top of taxes
- The monarchy kept spending money like crazy, even getting into debt for their elaborate projects such as the [[Enlightenment and Revolutions#The arts|palace of Versailles]]

#### Connection to previous units

- The idea of no taxation without representation is seen with how the lower class had to pay taxes while they did not have majority of the vote which meant they had pretty much no say

## Major Events/Groups

### Declaration of the Rights of Man

- National Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen which gave the people their natural rights
  - This document was inspired by the English bill of rights and american revolution
  - Such as “liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.”
  - Equality to all men and no unfair taxation
  - Freedom of the press
- But it assumed women should not deal with political matters

### A new constitution

- The National Assembly creates a new constitution, the Constitution of 1791, with a limited monarchy
  - There would be a king but the Legislative Assembly would make the laws
  - This Legislative Assembly consisted of quite well off men over 25 who paid enough taxes
- King Louis XIV attempted to flee France in June 1791 but was captured by the people and brought back
  - The people were very disrespected over this as it showed the king had no interest in the people's wants

### Rise of the Paris Commune

- Radical protesters organized a attack on the royal palace and Legislative Assembly
  - Took the king captive, forced the Assembly to suspend the monarchy and allow all adult males the right to vote
  - This protest was very violent, a signal for even more violent behavior as the people get high on this frenzy

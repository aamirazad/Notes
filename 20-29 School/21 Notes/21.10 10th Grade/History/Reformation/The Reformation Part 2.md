## Assessment

1. Done in notes
2. Done in notes
3. Describe the results of "Bloody Mary's" religious policy?

Bloody Mary had many radical actions to stop the Protestants. One of which is how, "show had more than three hundred Protestants burned as heretics." This killing had lots of effects but not as she expected, Protestantism became more popular because of this. This idea of getting stronger during oppression is a core belief in the history of the U.S.

1. How was religious reforms in Zurich aligned with the reformation?

Religious reforms, spreading from France's reformation, appeared in Zurich Switzerland. Reforms were placed such as "\[abolishing\] relics and images" and "\[removing\] all paintings and decorations." (178). This aligned with some of the reformation views like challenging church authority, emphasis on the bible, and simplification of worship.

1. Do you think Henry VIII was a religious man?

Henry VIII was not a religious man, and even though he controlled the church he only did that for power and not religious purposes. When he was not allowed to divorce his wife he made the, "Act of Supremacy in 1534 \[that\] declared the king was 'taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head on earth of the new Church of England." (179). This example of Henry showing no care for the structure of the Church and it's spiritual aspects by becoming the ruler just for his own gain. Based on the picture he was self centered and only tried to look and be imposing as most kings do.

4. New branches of Christianity was created to meet the peoples wants
5. The Church had a reform

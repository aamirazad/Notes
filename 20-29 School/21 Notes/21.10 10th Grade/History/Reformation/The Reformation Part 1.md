# The Reformation Part 1

### Overview

- The Protestant Reformation is a religious reform movement that divided the Church into Catholic and Protestant Groups
- Caused not only by Martin Luther but by earlier developments as well

### Christian Humanism

- Caused by the Italian Renaissance, a western movement was made to reform the Catholic Church
- Believe regular people were capable of improving themselves
- If they read the basic works of Christianity, they would be more pious

### Erasmas

- Focused on the self care aspect instead of pilgrimages
- Wrote The Praise of Folly that criticized aspects of society that needed reform
- "Laid the egg that Luther hatched"

### Corruption of the Church

- The Popes did not meet the Church's spiritual needs
  - They were getting greedy
- The Church was greedy while the common people wanted nothing but Salvation, acceptance into Heaven
- So the Church started selling indulgences, releases from hell

### Martin Luther

- Monk and Professor at the University of Wittenberg
- Believed, from reading the bible himself, that humans were not judged by their good works (physical possessions) but their faith to God

### The Ninety five theses

- Luther did not want to rebel, just telling the church of all the ways they need to change
- Greatly upset at the wide spread selling of indulgences
- 1517: Wrote a list of ninety-five theses to his Church superiors
- Because of the printing press. The paper became much more widespread, and many common people read it
- Including the pope who did not take it seriously, but later would, when the strength of the church would be impacted,

### He revolts

- Luther went from kindly asking to proposing radical changes
- Such as reforming the German Church, attacking the church's corrupt leaders, and calling for the clergy to marry; all while emphasizing that salvation came from faith not good work
- In January 1521, the Church summoned Luther to a hearing to decide his fate

### Lutheraism

- Luther's movement became a revolution
- Luther got the support of some german rulers who started to take control of their churches
- Some took it too far and tried to overthrow their lords in Luther's name, but Luther did not agree with this

### Politics

- Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, wanted to preserve the unity of religion but some problems caused Lutheranism to thrive
- German states supported Luther and organized troops against Charles
- They win with the Peace of Augsburg making Lutheranism an accepted religion alongside Catholicism

1. What were the consequences of Luther's Ninety-five theses?

Luther's Ninety-five theses had a very different impact than Luther expected. Instead of making the Church royalty, the paper spread throughout the common people. This made the majority of people during the time think twice at the Church and it's actions. This would cause a revolt and lessen the strength of the church.

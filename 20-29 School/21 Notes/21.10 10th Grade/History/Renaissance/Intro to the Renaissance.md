# Intro to the Renaissance

- Means rebirth
- Italy has it because they have more money and stuff
- After all of the intellect of Rome was lost, they tried to study it
- 476 AD, collapse of Rome: When you don't have people to teach the next generation. Knowledge is lost

## Social system in Italy

- The top of the pyramid are the merchants
- No royalty
- You need to make a ton of money to stay on the top
- They need to show their wealth to rule over others
- Analogy: We don't have as much power as Elon Musk

## First major place for Renaissance: Siena

- When you have a lot of people, you need a lot of water
- Unlike Rome's about ground aqueducts they dig tunnels underground

## Florence

- Competes with Siena
- has better trade, Siena has more people
- Siena fights them and wins

## The Black Death

- Kills 60% of Siena's population
- Siena loses all of its power

## To Build the Dome

- To lift the materials they used horses and donkeys
- To move materials left and right he sues a crane
- Bricks placed at angles help support weight
- Chiens prevents the brick from coming out

## Brunelleschi invents perspective

- Makes the dome look bigger by using the other buildings
- This changed art as well

## Pope Pius II

- Wanted to redesign the whole city to look more roman
- Streets were not straight so the town would not look as small; you couldn't see the end

# The History of Chemistry

Alchemy to Chemistry

### Alchemists

#### Tapputi-balatechallim

- 1200 BC
- Perfume maker; first chemist; used **distalization**

#### Ancient greeks

- Belief in 4 elements: earth, air fire, and water

#### Jabir iban Hayyan

- 450 BC (Later)
- Moved ideas from magic to science
- Created glassware and processes still used today
- Worked with distillation

#### Paracelsus

- 1493 (Later)
- Man consisted of three elements salt (body), sulphur (soul), mercury (spirit)
- Seeked for the ~mystical elixir of life~ medicine.

Alchemy: Search for the magical elixir of life or gold

#### Contributions of alchemists

- Mercury, sulfer, and antimony
- Element properties discovered and recoreded
- Creation of alloys
- Procedures

500 AD - Alchemy traveled to Western Europe

Web: Used to compare things

### Isotopes

- Neutrons is the glue, too much glue or too little glue and it causes it to not stick
- These atoms decay

#### Review

- What charge does a nucleus have?
  - It has a positive charge
- How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does an atom of fluorine-20 have?
  - 9 protons, 11 neutrons, 9 electrons
- How many proton, neutrons, and electrons does a -1 ion of fluorine-20 have
  - 9 protons, 11 neutrons, 10 electrons
- Are Uranium-235 and Neptunium-235 isotopes? Explain
  - CER answer: No, they aren't. By the definition of isotopes of different forms of the same element with different mass, both element must be the same. Since Uranium and Neptunium are different elements, they can't be isotopes.

### Weighted average

- Weighted Average of atomic masses of naturally occurring isotopes of a element
- Found on the periodic table

#### Example

- Chlorine-35: atomic mass = 34.969amu and percent abundance = 75.77%
- Chlorine-37: atomic mass = 36.966amu and percent abundance = 24.23%

(0.7577×34.969)+(0.2423×36.966)=35.46amu

### Naming molecular compounds

#### Flow chart



#### Covalent compounds

- Don't get prefix happy from naming ionic compounds
- If it has a metal it will NOT have a prefix
- Covalent bond: Created though shared electrons between typically non metals
- Polyatomic ions are ionic bonded
- Element farthest to the left is written first
- For prefixes
  - Double vowels lose the prefix's vowel
- End with -ide
- Examples
  - $\ce{ CCl4 }$- Carbon tetrachloride
  - $\ce{ N2O3 }$- Dinitrogen trioxide

## CER

Helps you explain lab results

### Claim

- Answer
- One to two sentences
- Ex:
  - What is the density of copper? - Prompt
  - The density of copper is … - Claim
- Completely answers the question

### Evidence

- How you came to the claim
- Should have gotten evidence from experts eg: NASA
- Not all data is evidence, just the stuff used to back up the claim

### Reasoning

- Connects claim to evidence
- Proves **why** the data is supporting the claim
- Ex:
  - So as mass and volume go up, density goes up - reasoning

Ex: What do plants need to grow?

- Claim: Plants need water, $\ce{ CO2 }$, and light to grow
- Evidence: Average of plants height, color, # of leaves
- Reasoning: Ties it to scientific property. Photosynthesis is when green plants produce sugar from water, $\ce{ CO2 }$, and light to grow. That is why the plants that got a consistent supply of all three grew the most.

Ex: Is air matter?

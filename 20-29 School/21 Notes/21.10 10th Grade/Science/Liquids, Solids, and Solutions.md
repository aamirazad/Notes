# Liquids, solids, and solutions

## Liquid properties

- Hard to compress (definite volume, no shape)
- High density (closer together)
- Move and flow
- Less KE than gas

#### Surface tension

- Resistance to increase surface area
- Would rather interact with the water particles than air
- Polar molecules have stronger surface tension
- Beading spheres

#### Viscosity

- Liquid's resistance to flow
- Strong forces: more viscous, harder to pour

#### Capillary action

Ability for a liquid to flow up against gravity

- Forces are responsible for [[Cohesion|Cohesion]]
- When gravity is stronger than cohesive force, it breaks
- Forces with unlike [[Adhesion|Adhesion]]

## Solid properties

- A collection of atoms or molecules closely packed together
- Definite size and shape

### Crystalline

- Perfectly organized groups closely packed together
- Sharp edges, flat surfaces
- Sugar, salt, gems, ice

### Amorphous

- Instead of taking a large time to get ready, it is made super quickly so its disorganized
- Not organized groups
- Brittle
- No definite melting point
- Cotton candy, window glass, rubber
- Caused by being cooled too fast
- MMIC

### Metal

- Made up by only metal atoms and molecules
- Held by metallic bonds
- Good conductors
- Gold, aluminum, silver

### Molecular

- Covalent atoms or molecules (2 non-metals)
- Held together by intermolecular forces
- Low melting points, poor conductors
- Sugar, ice

### Ionic

- Made up of [[Cations|Cations]] and [[Anions|Anions]] (metal and non-metals)
- Strong electrostatic attractions
- High melting points, low conductivity as solids
- Table salt
- Salt WATER high conductors (not salt on it's own)

### Covalent network

- Giant covalently bonded compounds
- Very hard, high melting points, poor conductors
- Diamond, graphite

### Challenge

- Classify the following solids
- (Not checked)

| Molecular          | Metallic | Covalent Network |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------- |
| $H_{2}O$           | Bronze   | Diomond          |
| $H_{2}$            |          |                  |
| $NH_{4}NO_{3}$     |          |                  |
| $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ |          |                  |

- Draw a particulate diagram of $H_{2}O$ as a crystalline and amorphous

### Bell ringer

- What would happen when you cool water to $0\degree C$
  - It would freeze more fully

## Phases

### Phase diagrams

![[./wiki/Phase Diagram.svg|Phase Diagram.excalidraw]]

- Trends
  - High pressure prefer liquids and solids
    - Atoms are packed together
  - Low pressure high temperatures prefer gas
    - Less dense
  - High temperatures prefer liquids and gas
    - Less dense, more mobile
- Parts
  - Three phases: Solid liquid, gas
  - Triple Point
  - A single point where all three points **coexist**
- Critical Point
  - Point where liquids and gases become identical
  - High energy, but packed together
- Changes happens when energy is added or removed from a substance (heat)

### Phase changes

![[../../../../media/Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 19.02.10.svg|Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 19.02.10.excalidraw]]

- From solid to gas
  - Dry ice (too low pressure for liquid at that temperature)

### Adding energy

- Addition of heat is **endothermic**
  - similar:: [[./Matter#Reaction types|Matter > Reaction types]]
- Examples:
  - Melting: solid -> liquid
  - Boiling: liquid -> gas
  - Sublimation: solid -> gas

### Removing energy

- Phase changes where heat is removed is **exothermic**
  - similar:: [[./Matter#Reaction types|Matter > Reaction types]]
- Examples:
  - Freezing: liquid -> solid
  - Condensation: gas -> liquid
  - Deposition: solid -> gas

### Calculations

- Heat is energy measured in joules (J)
  $$
  q = mC\Delta T
  $$
- q - Energy in J, m - mass in g, C - specific heat capacity, $\Delta T$ - change in temp (Final temp - Initial temp)

#### Specific heat capacity

- Amount of heat to raise the temperature of 1 gram of substance by $1\degree C$
- Constant unique for every compound
- Units $\frac{J}{g}$

### Heating curve

- Heat is added, phase changes is shown

![[../../../../media/Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 21.02.45.svg|Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 21.02.45.excalidraw]]

- During a phase change, there is no change in temp
- So the flat lines are changes in potential energy
  - The intermolecular forces that hold the atoms together must be broken to let it be more spread out
  - During this time, the temperature doesn't increase even though energy is added, potential energy increases
- So on the vertical lines show the substance increasing in temperature but not changing state

![[../../../../media/Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 20.55.01.svg|Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 20.55.01.excalidraw]]

- This graph is different because it is going from solid straight to gas (sublimation, deposition)
- You can tell because there is only one phase change. So whatever the material, it is at a low enough pressure for it to not be able to become a liquid

### More calculations

- Portions of a "curve" without temperature changes

$$
q = \Delta H_{fus} \cdot n
$$

![[../../../../media/Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 21.07.18.svg|Liquids, Solids, and Solutions 2024-03-29 21.07.18.excalidraw]]

- Because the line between liquid and gas is longer (more heat = more time) the \[â€¦\] is higher
- It takes less energy to go from _all_ the intermolecular forces to _some_, than from _some_ to _none_

### Examples

## Intermolecular forces

### Intra-molecular forces

- Covalent, ionic
- Hard to break apart bonds
- Results in new atoms, molecules (not phase changes)

### Inter-molecular forces

- Things that are broken in phase diagrams
- Attractions between separate particles
- Week, changes in state
- Types: (strongest to weakest)
  - Dipole - dipole
  - London dispersion
  - Hydrogen "Bonds" (not really a bond)

### Hydrogen bonding

- Interaction between a hydrogen atom and a highly electromotive atom in a polar molecule
- Only Florine, Nitrogen, or Oxygen (FON)
- Negative dipole is attracted to the positive end

### Dipole-dipole interactions

- Interactions between positive dipole and negative dipole
- Liquids and solids

### London dispersion

- What holds non-polar molecules together?
- As electrons spin around, sometimes electrons might be on one side of a atom
- But only for a split second, most of the time there is no force holding it together; weak
- All molecules have some amount of London dispersion forces
- Larger molecules polarize easier
  - It is much less likely that hundred of electrons are evenly dispersed in large atoms

### Steps for calculating

- If non-polar (no dipoles OR all dipoles cancel) --> London Dispersion
- If polar (positive and negative poles) --> London dispersion AND dipole-dipole forces
- IF POLAR, then can it hydrogen bond? (Hydrogen bonding is FON!)

### Practice

> [!question]- What intermolecular forces are present in $CH_{3}OH$?
>
> 1. Is it polar?
>    - Draw the Lewis structure (it is)
> 1. Can it form Hydrogen bonds?
>    - Are there Hydrogen bonded with FON?
>
> - It is London dispersion, Dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonded

> [!question]- What intermolecular forces are present in $CH_{4}$?
>
> 1.  Is it polar?
>     - No
>
> - It is london dispersion because only london dispersion forces occur in non polar molecules

## Solubility

- The maximum amount of **solute** that will dissolve in a given amount of **solvent**
- Creates a solution
- Water - the universal solvent

### Calculating

- Solubility is measured in Molarity (M)
  - How many moles of a **solute** are in 1 liter of **solvent**

#### Example

> [!question]- 250 grams of NaCl are dissolved in 100. mL of water. What is the molarity?
>
> $$
> 250gNaCl \cdot \frac{1molNaCl}{58.44gNaCL} = 4.3 molNaCL
> $$
>
> $$
> 100mLH_{2}O \cdot \frac{1L}{1000ml} = 0.100 L H_{2}O
> $$
>
> $$
> \frac{4.3molNaCl}{0.100LH_{2}O} = 43 \frac{mol}{L}  = 43M
> $$

### Dilutions

- Dilution happens when the amount of solvent increases without increasing the amount of solute (more water)
- To calculate the new concentration use this equation
  $$
  M_{1}V_{1} = M_{2}V_{2}
  $$
- $M_{1}$ = Initial molarity
- $V_{1}$ = Initial volume of solution
- $M_{2}$ = Final molarity
- $V_{2}$ = Final volume of solution

#### Example

> [!question]- If 455 ml of $6.0MNO_{3}$ is diluted to 2.5 L, what is the morality of the diluted solution?
> $$ \frac{M*{1}}{V*{1}} = M\_{2} $$
> $$ \frac{6.0M \cdot 0.455L}{2.5L} = 1.1M $$

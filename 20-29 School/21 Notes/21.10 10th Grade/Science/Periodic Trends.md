# Periodic trends  
  
## Periodic table trends  
  
### Periodic table review  
  
- Columns are families  
  - They hold the building up  
- Rows are periods  
  - Periods end the sentence from left to right  
  
### Atomic size  
  
- Size goes up as you move **down**  
  - Hr has 1 energy level. Fr has 7 ))))))) - Bigger  
  - Shielding effect  
  - All the layers of clothes protect the nucleus from feeling the force  
  - Weak coulombic effect  
- Size goes **DOWN** as you move across the period  
  - Not what you would think  
  - Coulombic effect is higher  
    - More protons means slightly greater force  
  - This makes the particles squeeze tighter  
- Top to bottom, the dominant factor is protons, left to right the dominant factor is size  
  
#### Review  
  
Which is bigger?  
  
1. Na or K  
  
- K, more layers (bigger)  
  
1. Na or Mg  
  
- Na, less coulombic effect, more spread  
  
1. Al or I  
  
- More layers, dominant factor  
  
### Ionization energy  
  
#### Definition  
  
- Energy required to remove an electron from an atom (in the gas phase)  
- $\ce{ Mg(g) + \pu{ 730kJ } -> Mg+ (g) + e- }$  
- This is called the First ionization energy because the outermost electron removed  
- The next electron takes more energy to remove  
  
#### Cer  
  
Ca would have a lower IE because it's outermost electron has a lower coulombic attraction holding it in.  
  
#### Ionization energy trends  
  
- IE increases across a period because the positive change increases  
- Metals lose electrons  
  
#### Review  
  
Which has the higher IE?  
  
1. Mg or Ca  
  
- Mg, closer electrons  
  
1. Al or S  
  
- S, more protons  
  
1. Cs or Ba  
  
- Ba, more protons  
  
### Electronegativity  
  
- Ability for an atom to attract electrons to itself  
- In a group: Atoms with fewer energy levels can attract electrons better, electronegativity decreases  
- In a period: More protons makes the atom attract electrons better so electronegativity increases  
- Scale from 0 - 4.0  
- Nobel gasses don't have electronegativity values as they are stable, don't attract electrons to itself  
- Metals have low, non-metals have big  
  
#### Review  
  
Which has higher electronegativity?  
  
1. F or Cl  
  
- F, less shielding  
  
1. Na or K  
  
- Na, less shielding  
  
1. Sn or I  
  
- I, more protons

## Balencing equations  
  
![[media/Balancing.svg|media/Balancing.svg]]  
  
- Diatomic elements acronyms  
  - ClIF H. RrON  
  - HONClBrIF  
- When balancing  
  - Save 1+ or 0 for the end  
  - Subscripts are used to deal with charge  
  - Number in front used to deal with equasion  
  - _Exo_ thermic reactions equal to negative and vise versa

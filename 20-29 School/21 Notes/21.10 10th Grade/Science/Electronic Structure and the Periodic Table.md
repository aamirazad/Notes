# Electronic structure and the periodic table

## Light

### 1 Minute of writing about light

Light has energy. The different amount of energy, called wavelength, has different properties. The visible spectrum is such that the length of the wavelength interests with our eyes creating colors and visuals. Light is invisible because we don't see it until it finished traveling thought the air.

### Why study light?

- Light and electrons have similar properties
- Elements can emit light
- It was originally thought that light was a wave 〜 (not a particle)
- 1900 light could not act like a wave AND a particle

### Example problem

- What is the wavelength of radiation that has a frequency of 4.3x10<sup>14</sup>

### Einstein

- Provides evidence of protons
- Proton is the packet of energy
- Photos are quantized light
- Absorption of photos of a specific energy explains photonic effect

### Sketchnoting

### Photoelectric effect

![Photoelectric effect diagram](photoelecric_effect.png)

- Shows that light is made of particles of light
- Certain colors eject electrons, some do not
- Proves light is a particle
  - Vending machine analogy
    - Putting little bits of money in a vending machine doesn't spit out a skittle. All at once, does. Too much only gives one pack, left over is still there
  - Putting little energy over time doesn't spit out a electron, all at once only spits out one electron. Too much only gives one electron.

### Max Planck

- Conceived the idea of photoelectric effect, doesn't get credit
- ℎ - planck's constant
  - How frequency and energy are related
  - Example
    - V = 4.84x10<sup>14</sup>/s
    - E?
    - E = 6.626x10<sup>-34</sup>J/s
  - Another example
    - One photon of UV light has wavelength of 200 nm. What is one mole of photon
    - ℎ = 6.63x10<sup>34</sup>
    - λ = 200x10<sup>-9</sup>m
    - v = c/λ
    - Answer: 5.98 kJ/mol

## The new atom

### Bohr's model

- Electrons do not travel in a cloud, but order the nucleus in distinct paths
- Called orbits
- Particles nature of electrons
- The father from the nucleus the electron is, the higher energy it has
- Purple light in a bright line spectrum has more energy than red
- Distinct lines mean it's from a single type of energy
- Electrons with high energy state (excited state) jumps up, then it drops down release energy (ground state)
  - What comes up must come down
- This is the lines in a bright line spectrum
- Energy of a photos = different between ground and excited
- They don't jump unless there is energy coming in (heat, electricity)

![Bohr's Model](bohrs_model.png)

- Quantum leap: when an electron jumps from one orbit, according to Bohr's model, it doesn't travel, it just teleports. This obvious flaw, along with the fact that Bohr's model only worked with Hydrogen was solved by:

### Schrödinger model

- Fixes the issues with Bohr's model
- Wave properties of atoms; works with all atoms
- e<sup>-</sup> in orbitals or e<sup>-</sup> clouds, _not orbits_
- __Cannot__ pinpoint the location of a e<sup>-</sup>
  - Instead uses statistics and high probability
- Perfected model

### Arrangement of electrons

- Main energy levels 1,2,3..
- Sublevel model demonstration: s, p, d, f
  - In a orbital there is:
    - 1s
    - 3p
    - 7f
  - Each orbital only has 2 electrons

### Electron configuration

- 2p<sup>2</sup>
- Doesn't show Hund's rule, which subset

#### Practice

- Fluorine #9
  - 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>5</sup>
- Niobium # 41
  - 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>15</sup>4p<sup>6</sup>

- Within a block the exponent increase for each column
- Coefficient increase by one per row (d-block is one behind)

#### Rules

- Aufbau: lowest orbital first
- Pauli: Spin must flip
- Hunds rule; separate before together

- An electron can be excited which would look like this

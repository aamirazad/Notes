# Measurement

## Units

### Base units

- The SI unit for mass is the **kilogram**
- Measures mass using a scale

| Physical Quality    | Name     | Abbreviation |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Mass                | Kilogram | kg           |
| Length              | Meter    | m            |
| Time                | Seconds  | s            |
| Temperature         | Kelvin   | k            |
| Amount of substance | Mole     | mol          |
| Electric current    | Ampere   | Amp          |

### Prefixes

| Prefix | Abbreviation | Factor         | Name       |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| Giga\* | G            | 1,000,000,000x | billion    |
| Mega\* | M            | 1,000,000x     | million    |
| Kilo   | k            | 1,000x         | thousand   |
| Hecto  | h            | 100x           | hundred    |
| Deka   | da           | 10x            | ten        |
|        |              | 0              | one        |
| deci   | d            | 0\.1           | tenth      |
| centi  | c            | 0\.01          | hundredth  |
| milli  | m            | 0\.001         | thousandth |
| micro  | Î¼            | 0\.000 001     | millionth  |
| nano   | n            | 0\.000 000 001 | billionth  |

\* - Not testable

### Derived unit

- Meter<sup>3</sup> = Liter(L)
- Density = mass / volume

## Dimensional analysis

#### Practice

### Unit conversions to know

- 2\.54 cm = 1 inch
- 454 g = 1 pound
- 1 cm<sup>3</sup> = 1 mL

#### Should already know

- 3600 s = 1 hour
- 5280 ft = 1 mile

### Dimensional challenge

### Scientific notation

- A good way to represent very small or very big numbers
- Quantitative numbers
- Any number can be represented by a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10

### Uncertainty in measurement

**All measurements are estimated**

Ex: 25.34

3 certain digits 1 uncertain

Tells us about the measuring tool

### Precision and accuracy

#### Precision

- The reproducibility or repeated measurements of the same thing
- Same thing over and over
- Standard deviation, significant factors

#### Accuracy

- The closeness of the measured value to the true or accepted value
- How _correct_ it is
- Percent error

### Percent error

$$
\frac{\text{Value accepted} \cdot \text{Value experimental}}{\text{Value accepted}} \cdot 100\%
$$

## Significant figures

Measurement of all digits known with certainty + one uncertain final digit

Rules:

1. All non-zero digits are counted as significant
2. All leading zeros are NOT counted (**0**.5)
3. Captive zeros are counted
4. Trailing zeros are only counted when a decimal point supersedes it

**It was measured by the scientist**

###

Examples:

- 33\.3 - 3 SF
- **1** 00 **4**.**1** - 5 SF (Even though there are 2 captive)
- 9000000 - 1 SF (Trailing no decimal)
- 0\.0000072 - 2 SF (Trailing, not significant)
- 82\.6000 - 6 SF (Trailing, decimal) (Trailing shows precision measured)

## Significant figures edpuzzle

8 cm 8.0 cm 8.00 cm

More digits means you are more and more precise

### Recording

Include all digits you can read (EVERYONE agrees), plus one digit that you can estimate (this varrys from person to person)

![qownnotes-media-hBvFEf](qownnotes-media-hBvFEf.png)

- We KNOW the 2 because the ruler tells us this. Estimate one more place value

### Counting

1. All non-zero numbers are significant
2. Zeros between non-zero digits (captive) are significant
3. Leading zeros are **not** significant
4. Trailing zeros are not significant **unless** there is a zero

![qownnotes-media-QhcYiw](qownnotes-media-QhcYiw.png)

This is because non significant zeros are placeholders. 5,200 could be written like 5.2 x 10<sup>3</sup> So these zeros are not necessary

## Calculating significant figures

#### Multiplication and division

- The number of significant figures in your answer replace the most uncertain amount

#### Addition and subtraction

- The number of significant figures cannot exceed the place value of the least precise number
- You are only as good as your weakest link

### Examples

#### Multiplication and division

#### Addition and subtraction

### Conversions

- 12 inches is EXACTLY 1 foot
- 60 seconds is EXACTLY 1 minute

No significant figures stuff

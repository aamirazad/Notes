# Covalent Bonds

### Overview

![[media/Covalent Bonds overview.svg|media/Covalent Bonds overview.svg]]

- My attempt at teaching the class a bit of
  this unit is located at [[Covalent bonds presentation|Covalent bonds presentation]]

## The bond

### Chemical bond types

- The attractive force that holds two or more atoms/ions together
- Covalent Bonds come from sharing electrons between atoms
  - Usually found between non metals
- [[Ionic bonds|Ionic bonds]] come from the transfer of electrons and then a attraction between opposite charges
  - Usually found between a metal and non metal
- Metallic bonds: attractive force holding pure metals together

### How covalent bonds are made

![[media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-22 20.46.0.svg|media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-22 20.46.0.svg]]

- 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁴ -> Electron config for sulpur
- \[Ne\] 3s² 3p⁴ -> 6 valence electrons (2+4)
- The number of valence electrons can also be found by taking it's family number - 10. So for sulphur which is in family 16, it has 6 valence electrons



#### Octet rule

- Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons until they are surrounded by 8 valence electrons (4 electron pairs)
  - "Eight is great"
  - It has exceptions though
  - Which is stronger
    - NaCl or NH3
- Exceptions:
  - Groups 1, 2, 13 might have less than a octet and are happy
  - Below the 3rd period, it can accept more electrons
  - Or if there is not a better way to do it
  - Florine is a example of a exception

#### Review

- How many valence electrons for 6e
  - 4
- Draw the dot structure of Ge

### Electronegativity

- Ions will always be stronger than covalent bonds, but between two covalent bonds, to find the atom that is pulling harder, you use electronegativity
- Ability to attract electrons
- Pauling set electronegativites on a scale from 0.2 to 4.0
- The difference in electronegativity determines if electrons are shared equally (non-polar covalent) or non evenly (polar)
- 0-0.4 - Non polar, 0.41 - 1.7 polar, 1.71+ Ionic
- Ex:
  - $Al_2O_3$
  - 3.44-1.61 = 1.24 - Ion

## Lewis structures

![[media/Lewis Structures.svg|media/Lewis Structures.svg]]

- To know how many bonds an element can make, use mnemonic:
- HONC 1234 - Hydrogen like make 1 bond, Oxygen like to make 2…
  ![[media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-23 16.42.50.svg|media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-23 16.42.50.svg]]

### More complex structures

- Find the central atom
  - Low electronegativity
  - More bonding sites
- Carbon has less electronegativity than Florine so it goes in the middle

![[media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-26 09.34.05.svg|media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-26 09.34.05.svg]]

- Elements in the same group (like N and P) have the same number of valence electrons to bond

#### Practice

- How many valence electrons do each element in $CH_3F$
  - C = 4, H = 1, F = 7
- What is the total number of valence electrons
  - 14
- What is the Lewis structure
  
- Is carbon happy?
- No, carbon and oxygen is unhappy because they don't have eight (it has )

### Double bonds

- 4 electrons are shared

![[media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-26 20.53.10.svg|media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-26 20.53.10.svg]]

### Triple bonds

- 6 electrons are share
- $C_2H_2$

![[media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-28 18.18.56.svg|media/Covalent Bonds 2024-02-28 18.18.56.svg]]

- As you increase bonds, the strength increases but the length decreases
  - Like folding a string

### Multiple atoms practice



### Formal charge

- Way of determining the best structure
- Mathematical formula
- Like HONC 1234



- Go though the process
- Central atom - Can't be 2
- HONC 1234 - Can't be 4
- In 1 everyone is happy, in 3 O doesn't have all 8 valence electrons

### Resonance



- All the same
- They are all existing at the same time
- The electron is moving the bond but it doing so all the time so it's pretty much always all three
- [[Covalent Bonds 2024-02-27 21.52.24.excalidraw|More practice]]

## VSPER molecular shapes

- Valence shell electron pair repulsion
- Predicts the shape of molecules and ions by minimizing electron pair repulsion
- Pretty much electrons don't like to be near electrons so they spread out as much as possible
- 5 geometries that give 13 shapes, only focusing on 5

#### Shapes of larger elements

## Polar molecules

- A polar molecule must have
  - Polar bonds
  - NOT symmetric
- Symmetry is determined by the bond exes only

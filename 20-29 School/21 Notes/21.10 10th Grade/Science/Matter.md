# Matter

## Scientific method and experimental design

### Scientific method

- Process of inquiry that follows scientific inquiries
- But don't focus on the common definition. Focus on

### Experimental design

- We have previous knowledge and scientific questions
- People we know, things we learned from experience

### What is a hypothesis actually?

- A testable answer. Beliefs are not testable
- A prediction. A explanation but on trial.

### Control vs constant

- Control:
  - Group we are comparing
  - Make sure we are comparing the right change
  - Functions under standard environment
- Constant:
  - Variable that is carefully controlled
  - ONE variable studied

### Positive and negative controls

- Negative control:
  - Subjected to all things except the thing being studied
- Positive control:
  - Confirms that the system is working. The positive control is know to give a positive control

### Independent and dependent variable

- Independent variable:
  - What the scientist chooses to change
- Dependent variable:
  - What the scientist measures to see the impact

### Recording observations

- Quantitative: associated with numbers
- Qualitative: And observation not tied to numbers. Not subjective

## Chemistry

- The study of the composition and structure of materials and the changes they undergo

Composition is what it's made of, structure is how it is put together.

- Chemistry is in a lot of things, cooking pigments, technology, farming…
- Three most important words:
  - **Structure, composition, change**

### Natural sciences

Biological (biology, ecology) - living things
Physical (chemistry, physics) - non-living things
We are doing physical

### Branches of chem

Organic - Carbon
Inorganic - Elements other than carbon
Physical - Properties and transformations
Biochemistry - Life
Analytical - Composition of materials

### Fact, law, theory

#### Fact

Phenomenon repeatedly confirmed by observation

#### Law

Laws say **how** something happens

- Newton's Law of motion

Could be explained usually with an equation

#### Theory

Something we know because it is supported by a large body of evidence

- Not altered
- **Explain WHY an event occurs**
- Theories do not become facts, they explain facts

### Limits

Science cannot address supernatural phenomena

## Matter

### Vocab

- _Matter:_ anything that has mass and occupies space
  Things that aren't matter:
  - Sound, energy, light
- _Energy:_ Ability to cause change or ability to do work
  - Kinetic, potential

### States of matter

- Solids, Liquids and Gas… Plasma

### Pogil recap

![Matter can be mixtures or pure substances](../../../../media/qownnotes-media-uRFCVb.png)

### Mixtures

- 2 or more types of matter, can be _separated_ by physical means
- Two subcategory
- Heterogeneous - Not uniform
  - Parts can be identified from other parts
- Homogeneous - Uniform

### Pure substances

- Every part of it is the same
- Unlike a mixture, it cannot be separated without a chemical change
  - Think how blood is a homogeneous mixture but you can still separate it by spinning it

### Laws of definite composition

- A compound contains the same element in exactly the same proportions by mass
- Water is always H<sup>2</sup>O

### Separation of mixtures

- Filtration
- Centrifugation
- Decant
- Distillation
- Chromatography
- Centrifuge
- Crystallize

List or identify these for the test

## Properties of matter

### Physical properties

_Can_ be can be measured without changes in identity

Two types:

- **Extensive** - depends on the amount (length)
- **Intensive** - does not depend on the amount (boiling point)

### Chemical properties

_Cannot_ be measured without changing the identity of the substance

- Boiling
- Rusting
- Flammability

### Physical changes

Does not result in a change of identity when observed

- Phase changes

### Chemical changes

Substances changed into different substances

### Chemical reactions

Reactants -> Products
Ingredients -> Result

### Indications

- Heat and light
- Production of gas
- Formation of precipitate

### Reaction types

![[../../../../media/qownnotes-media-JUaJnN.png|Charts of Exo and Endo thermic reations]]

Exo - exit
Endo -- enter

## Types of elements

### Metals

- Shiny
- Conducts electricity and heat
- Ductile and malleable
- Mostly solids

### Nonmetals

- Colorful
- Brittle
- Poor conductors
- Mostly gases

### Metalloids

- Mix of both
- Semiconductors
- All solids

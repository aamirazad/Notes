## Formulas

Alcohol Fermentation formula

: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> --Zymase --> 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + 2CO<sub>2</sub> 

Cellular Respiration formula

: 6O<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> --> 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + energy

## General Information

Enzyme is used in alcohol Fermentation

: Zymase

Alcohol Fermentation's waste

: Ethanol and CO<sub>2</sub> as waste

Site of Alcohol Fermentation

: Yeast

Creation of Alcohol Fermentation

: Eduard Buchner, 1897

ATP

: Adenosine Triphosphate - stores and releases energy

**c**alorie

: The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree Celsius

**C**alorie

: 1000 calories

Cell Membrane? 

: A phospholipid Bi-layer that divides interior and exterior sections of the cell

Cellular Respiration?

: Process that releases energy by breaking down glucose in the presence of oxygen

Chemical Energy?

: The energy of chemical substances that is released when they undergo a chemical reaction and transform into other substances. 

CO<sub>2</sub>

: Carbon Dioxide, waste product

Cori Cycle

: Process of transporting lactate from cells that are undergoing anaerobic metabolism to the liver where it is passed to provide glucose back to the cell

Cytoplasm

: Fluid inside cell but outside nucleus

ETC

: Electron Transport Chain--uses high energy electrons from Krebs Cycle to convert 32 ADPs to 32 ATPs. Series of carrier proteins located in the inner membrane of mitochondrion
Glucose

C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
: Simple sugar w/ high energy storage

Glycolysis

: Process in which one molecule of Glucose is broken in half by 2 ATPs producing two molecules of pyruvic acid. 

H<sub>2</sub>O

: Water--Waste Product

Heat energy

: 60% of energy from glucose is released as heat

Inner Membrane of Mitochondrion

: Forms Cristae, and is site of ETC

Krebs Cycle

: Pyruvic acid is broken down into CO2 in a series of energy extracting reactions. Occurs in matrix of mitochondrion 

Lactic acid

: Waste product--forms when cell breaks down carbs

Matrix

: Fluid inside inner membrane

NAD+ 

: Carrier Protein that carries electrons

NADH 

: Carrier protein with H+ ion

FADH2

: High energy electron carrier 


ATPs made by gylcolysis

: 2

ATPs made during Fermentation

: 2 

ATPs the Krebs cycle makes 

: 2

ATPs the Electron Transport Chain makes 

: 32

## Formulas  
  
> [!info]+ Alcohol Fermentation formula  
> $C_6H_{12}O_6 \xrightarrow{\text{Zymase}} 2C_2H_5OH + 2CO_2$  
  
> [!info]+ Cellular Respiration formula  
> $6O_2 + C_6H_{12}O_6 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{energy}$  
  
## General Information  
  
> [!info]+ Enzyme used in Alcohol Fermentation  
> Zymase  
  
> [!info]+ Alcohol Fermentation's waste  
> Ethanol and $CO_2$ as waste  
  
> [!info]+ Site of Alcohol Fermentation  
> Yeast  
  
> [!info]+ Creation of Alcohol Fermentation  
> Eduard Buchner, 1897  
  
> [!info]+ ATP  
> Adenosine Triphosphate - stores and releases energy  
  
> [!info]+ **c**alorie  
> The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree Celsius  
  
> [!info]+ **C**alorie  
> 1000 calories  
  
> [!info]+ Cell Membrane  
> A phospholipid Bi-layer that divides interior and exterior sections of the cell  
  
> [!info]+ Cellular Respiration  
> Process that releases energy by breaking down glucose in the presence of oxygen  
  
> [!info]+ Chemical Energy  
> The energy of chemical substances that is released when they undergo a chemical reaction and transform into other substances.   
  
> [!info]+ $CO_2$  
> Carbon Dioxide, waste product  
  
> [!info]+ Cori Cycle  
> Process of transporting lactate from cells that are undergoing anaerobic metabolism to the liver where it is passed to provide glucose back to the cell  
  
> [!info]+ Cytoplasm  
> Fluid inside cell but outside nucleus  
  
> [!info]+ ETC  
> Electron Transport Chain--uses high energy electrons from Krebs Cycle to convert 32 ADPs to 32 ATPs. Series of carrier proteins located in the inner membrane of mitochondrion  
  
> [!info]+ Glucose  
> $C_6H_{12}O_6$: Simple sugar with high energy storage  
  
> [!info]+ Glycolysis  
> Process in which one molecule of Glucose is broken in half by 2 ATPs producing two molecules of pyruvic acid.   
  
> [!info]+ $H_2O$  
> Water--Waste Product  
  
> [!info]+ Heat energy  
> 60% of energy from glucose is released as heat  
  
> [!info]+ Inner Membrane of Mitochondrion  
> Forms Cristae, and is site of ETC  
  
> [!info]+ Krebs Cycle  
> Pyruvic acid is broken down into $CO_2$ in a series of energy extracting reactions. Occurs in the matrix of mitochondrion   
  
> [!info]+ Lactic acid  
> Waste product--forms when cell breaks down carbs  
  
> [!info]+ Matrix  
> Fluid inside the inner membrane  
  
> [!info]+ NAD+   
> Carrier Protein that carries electrons  
  
> [!info]+ NADH   
> Carrier protein with $H^+$ ion  
  
> [!info]+ FADH2  
> High energy electron carrier   
  
> [!info]+ ATPs made by glycolysis  
> 2  
  
> [!info]+ ATPs made during Fermentation  
> 2   
  
> [!info]+ ATPs the Krebs cycle makes   
> 2  
  
> [!info]+ ATPs the Electron Transport Chain makes   
> 32

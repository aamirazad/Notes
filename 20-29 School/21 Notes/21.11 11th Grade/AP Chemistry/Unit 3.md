# Unit 3  
  
Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic.  
  
## 3.1 Intermolecular and Interparticle Forces  
  
- Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are forces between one molecule to another  
  
### State changes  
  
- State changes are when intermolecular forces become stronger or weaker, there is no change in identity  
- Caused by changes in force (energy added to create motion in the particles)  
- When energy is added to water, it becomes a gas, intermolecular distances increase, intermolecular iteration decreases  
  
### Dipole-dipole  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Dipole-dipole interactions|◀️]]  
  
- The force between two polar molecules  
- The partial negative on a polar molecule attracts the partial positive of another polar molecule  
- The molecules orient each other so negatives are near positives  
- Not as strong as a bond, the energy is around 1% of it  
  
### Dipole-induced dipole  
  
- The force between a polar molecule and a non polar molecule  
- When a polar molecule gets near a non polar molecule, the repulsion between the electrons of each molecule create a slight dipole on the non polar molecule  
- The the magnitude of the dipole and the size of the non polar molecule changes its strength  
  
### London Dispersion forces (LDFs)  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#London dispersion|◀️]]  
  
- The force between two non polar molecules  
- When two molecules get close together, the randomly fluctuating electrons create temporary dipoles which polarizes the second molecule creating a temporary dipole between the two molecules  
- All molecules exhibit LDFs  
- The strength depends on how large the electron cloud is, the larger the cloud, the stronger the interaction  
- Molecules that are linear are stronger  
  
### Hydrogen "bonding"  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Hydrogen bonding|◀️]]  
  
- Not really a bond, only another interaction, this one weirdly stronger than above, even with very small atoms (usually larger atoms have larger forces)  
- It takes place between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom ($\ce{ N }$, $\ce{ O }$, or $\ce{ F }$) and a highly electronegative atom on another molecule  
  
### Ion-dipole  
  
- Happens between polar molecules and ions in a ionic compound  
- When ionic compounds dissolve in aqueous solution, the dipole of water interacts with the charged ions causing them to separate  
- The negative end of water, for instance, pulls the positively charged ions and the positive end of water pulls the negative ioins  
- Even stronger than hydrogen bonding  
  
## 3.2 Properties of Solids  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Solid properties|◀️]]  
  
### Ionic solids  
  
- Formed by cations (+) and anions (-) of each type surrounded by the other in a 3D lattice structure held together by lattice energy  
- Generally high melting and boiling points due to the strong columbic attraction between ions  
- Brittle  
	- Since they are in alternative shapes, if there is a shift, they repel  
- Poor conductors of electricity (not free flowing ions)  
  
### Molecular solids  
  
- Formed by neutral molecules  
- Exclusively non-metals  
- Low melting and boiling point and poor conductors of electricity  
  
### Covalent network solids  
  
- Formed by distinct atoms all bonded together in a 3D network  
- Formed by carbon and metalloids  
- High melting point and hardness, poor conductor of electricity  
  
### Graphite solids  
  
- Carbon in graphite is $\ce{ sp^{2} }$ hybridized  
- Forms long sheets of carbon atoms  
- Weak intermoleculear forces between the layers, but strong in each layer  
- Excellent conductor of electricity  
  
### Metallic solids  
  
- Formed by metals  
- Valence electrons are free for flow between electrons (known as the sea of electrons)  
- Great conductors of heat and electricity  
- Malleable and ductile (can be stretched into wires)  
- Melting points vary

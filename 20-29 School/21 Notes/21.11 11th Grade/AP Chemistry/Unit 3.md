# Unit 3  
  
Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic. I am now sectioning each topic based off of AP section instead of the book chapter since this unit is all over the place. I will most likely continue with this format.

## 3.1 Intermolecular and Interparticle Forces  
  
- Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are forces between one molecule to another  
  
### State changes  
  
- State changes are when intermolecular forces become stronger or weaker, there is no change in identity  
- Caused by changes in force (energy added to create motion in the particles)  
- When energy is added to water, it becomes a gas, intermolecular distances increase, intermolecular iteration decreases  
  
### Dipole-dipole  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Dipole-dipole interactions|◀️]]  
  
- The force between two polar molecules  
- The partial negative on a polar molecule attracts the partial positive of another polar molecule  
- The molecules orient each other so negatives are near positives  
- Not as strong as a bond, the energy is around 1% of it  
  
### Dipole-induced dipole  
  
- The force between a polar molecule and a non polar molecule  
- When a polar molecule gets near a non polar molecule, the repulsion between the electrons of each molecule create a slight dipole on the non polar molecule  
- The the magnitude of the dipole and the size of the non polar molecule changes its strength  
  
### London Dispersion forces (LDFs)  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#London dispersion|◀️]]  
  
- The force between two non polar molecules  
- When two molecules get close together, the randomly fluctuating electrons create temporary dipoles which polarizes the second molecule creating a temporary dipole between the two molecules  
- All molecules exhibit LDFs  
- The strength depends on how large the electron cloud is, the larger the cloud, the stronger the interaction  
- Molecules that are linear are stronger  
  
### Hydrogen "bonding"  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Hydrogen bonding|◀️]]  
  
- Not really a bond, only another interaction, this one weirdly stronger than above, even with very small atoms (usually larger atoms have larger forces)  
- It takes place between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom ($\ce{ N }$, $\ce{ O }$, or $\ce{ F }$) and a highly electronegative atom on another molecule  
  
### Ion-dipole  
  
- Happens between polar molecules and ions in a ionic compound  
- When ionic compounds dissolve in aqueous solution, the dipole of water interacts with the charged ions causing them to separate  
- The negative end of water, for instance, pulls the positively charged ions and the positive end of water pulls the negative ioins  
- Even stronger than hydrogen bonding  
  
## 3.2 Properties of Solids  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Solid properties|◀️]]  
  
### Ionic solids  
  
- Formed by cations (+) and anions (-) of each type surrounded by the other in a 3D lattice structure held together by lattice energy  
- Generally high melting and boiling points due to the strong columbic attraction between ions  
- Brittle  
	- Since they are in alternative shapes, if there is a shift, they repel  
- Poor conductors of electricity (not free flowing ions)  
  
### Molecular solids  
  
- Formed by neutral molecules  
- Exclusively non-metals  
- Low melting and boiling point and poor conductors of electricity  
  
### Covalent network solids  
  
- Formed by distinct atoms all bonded together in a 3D network  
- Formed by carbon and metalloids  
- High melting point and hardness, poor conductor of electricity  
  
### Graphite solids  
  
- Carbon in graphite is $\ce{ sp^{2} }$ hybridized  
- Forms long sheets of carbon atoms  
- Weak intermoleculear forces between the layers, but strong in each layer  
- Excellent conductor of electricity  
  
### Metallic solids  
  
- Formed by metals  
- Valence electrons are free for flow between electrons (known as the sea of electrons)  
- Great conductors of heat and electricity  
- Malleable and ductile (can be stretched into wires)  
- Melting points vary  
  
### Atomic solids  
  
- Atomic solids are ones made up of atoms of the same element bonded together  
  
### Identifying type by just formula

## 3.3 Solids, Liquids, and Gases  
  
[[Gases#States of matter|◀️]]  
  
- Solids are tightly packed, liquids are more spread out, filing the container, gases, particles are very spread out and fill the entire container  
  
## 3.4 Ideal Gas Law  
  
### Understanding the law  
  
[[Gases#Ideal gas law|◀️]]  
  
- Ideal gas law describe variables that effect gas behavior  
- $PV$ are both on the same side, so if everything else is held constant, pressure and volume are inversely related  
- Since they are on opposite sides, pressure and moles or temperature is directly related and volume and moles or temperature is directly related  
- For example, if the pressure drops by half in a sealed container, the moles couldn't go down so the temperature must have gone down, and drops by exactly half  
  
### Gas mixtures  
  
- Dalton's law of partial pressure says the total pressure of a sample of gas equals all the pressure's of the individual gasses  
- To calculate particle pressure just do part over whole  
  
![[Unit 3 2024-10-23 19.43.15.svg|Unit 3 2024-10-23 19.43.15.svg]]  
  
- Multiple things changing stack  
- Also remember to count the number of particles, we don't know the pressure on the right but since it has half as many particles and the same volume, it has a pressure of 1 atm (half the particles, half the pressure)  
- So when multiple gasses are combined the pressures add to make 2+1=3atm but the volume is halfing and since it is inversely related, the pressure doubles to 6atm  
- A particle is each one molecule so $\ce{ O2 }$ is one not 2  
  
## 3.5 Kinetic Molecular Theory  
  
- At the same temperature, lighter particles are moving faster and heavier particles are moving slowly, but they are exerting the same pressure on the walls  
- Molecular size only matters in very high pressure and small volume  
- The speeds of particles is always changing, but overall the speed remains the same at a certain temperature  
![[Unit 3 2024-10-23 19.54.53.svg|Unit 3 2024-10-23 19.54.53.svg]]  
  
- At a higher temperature, the standard deviation of the speeds is more meaning there are more variation in the speeds, but the average is still the same, greater than the lower temperature  
  
## 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law  
  
- As IMFs increase, actual pressure is less than expected  
- This only happens at low temperatures when IMFs become significant  
- As particle volume becomes significant (very low volume of container) actual pressure is greater than predicted  
- **Gases behave more ideally at high temperatures and low pressures**  
  
## 3.7 Solutions and Mixtures  
  
[[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Solubility|◀️]]  
  
$$  
\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}  
$$  
  
## 3.8 Representations of Solutions  
  
![[Unit 3 2024-10-23 20.20.18.svg|Unit 3 2024-10-23 20.20.18.svg]]  
## 3.9 Separation of Solutions and Mixtures  
  
- Chromatography separates components with different IMFs, the more polar a component, the less interaction with a polar stationary phase causing it to travel far, the less polar a component, the more interaction with a polar stationary phase causing it to travel less  
- The higher up, the less polar (if the paper is polar and the solution is not)  
- Distillation separates based on different boiling point (IMFs)  
  
## 3.10 Solubility  
  
- Ionic compounds dissolve in polar solvents  
- Polar dissolves polar, non polar dissolves non polar, but polar does not dissolve non polar (oil and water)  
  
## 3.11 Spectroscopy and the Electromagnetic Spectrum  
  
- Microwaves rotate, infrared vibrates, ultraviolet/visible promote electrons

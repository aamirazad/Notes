### Types of Chemical Bonds

[[Covalent Bonds#Chemical bond types|◀️]]

#### Ionic bonding

- Ionic bonding is formed when an atom that loses electrons easily reacts with a atom that has a high [[Affinity|affinity (hover over me!)]] for electrons\
	- Usually forms when a metal reacts with a nonmetals'
- Coulomb's Law
	- Used to calculate the energy of interaction between a pair of ions
	- The equation looks like this but you don't need to use or memorize it
	- $$F = k \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}$$
	- $k$ is a constant, $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ the ion charges and $r$ is the distance between the two
	- All you need to understand is if you have two large charges, there is a lot of bond strength, but if the distance is very large the charge goes down
	- Charge has a greater impact than distance

- Whats happening here
- It is showing that as the distance gets closer, the potential energy goes into the negatives, this is saying there is most attraction here
- But if you get too close, instead of the two nuclei pulling the electrons of each atom creating a bond, the two nuclei are repelling each other (positive to positive)
- So the bottom of the drop is the optimal distance where the attractive forces are maximized and repulsive intermolecular forces are minimized
- This is the bond length

#### Covalent Bonding

- A Non polar covalent bond is where two identical atoms share electrons equally
- Polar covalent bonds are a uneven sharing of electrons

> [!question]- Some plant fertilizer compounds are $\ce{ (NH4)2SO4 }$, $\ce{ Ca3(PO4)2 }$, $\ce{ K2O }$, $\ce{ P2O5 }$, and $\ce{ KCl }$. Which of these compounds contains both ionic and covalent bonds?
> $\ce{ (NH4)2SO4 }$ and $\ce{ Ca3(PO4)2 }$. In $\ce{ (NH4)2SO4 }$, the $\ce{ NH4 }$ and $\ce{ SO4 }$ are bonded covalently, but inside $\ce{ NH4 }$ and $\ce{ SO4 }$ there are ionic bonds holding the $\ce{ N }$ and $\ce{ H }$ together, for instance. Same for $\ce{ Ca3(PO4)2 }$

### Electronegativity

[[Covalent Bonds#Electronegativity|◀️]]

#### Polar bonds

[[Covalent Bonds#Polar molecules|◀️]]

- More electronically difference = greater polarity

> [!question] Order the polarity of these bonds in increasing order
> - $\ce{ H—H }$
> - $\ce{ O—H }$
> - $\ce{ Cl—H }$
> - $\ce{ S—H }$
>- $\ce{ F—H }$
>
> > [!question]- Answer
> >
> > $\ce{ H—H < S—H < Cl—H < O—H < F—H }$

### Bond Polarity and Dipole Moments

- Caused by a covalent bond where one atom has a higher electronegativity on the other in a uneven molecule
- For example in $\ce{ CO2 }$ its symmetric so not polar
![[Polar molecule.svg|Polar molecule.svg]]
- Arrow points to the more electronegative
- Another way of showing bond polarity is with electrostatic potential diagrams
![electrostatic-map](https://utfs.io/f/54iPPKBOVfGCgekdbC5NQOxlmVrj62Xu1ybzMeFYkvd4cnfU)
- Bigger blob + red means more electrons, its more electronegative so its pulling more electrons to its side

### Ions: Electron Configurations and Sizes

- When two nonmetals react to form a covalent bond, they share electrons in a way that completes the valence electron configurations of both atoms
- When a nonmetal and a metal react to form a binary ionic compound, the ions form so that the valence electron configuration of the nonmetal achieves the electron configuration of the next noble gas atom and Valence orbitals of the metal are emptied

> [!question] Which of the following ions have noble gas electron configurations?
>
> > [!question]- $\ce{ Fe^{2+}, Fe^{3+}, Sc^{3+}, Co^{3+} }$
> >
> > $\ce{ Sc^{+3} }$
>
> > [!question]- $\ce{ Tl+, Te^{2-}, Cr^{3+} }$
> >
> > $\ce{ Te^{2-} }$
>
> > [!question]- $\ce{ Pu^{4+}, Ce^{4+}, Ti^{4+} }$
> >
> > $\ce{ Ce^{4+}, Ti^{4+}}$

- You should already know that atoms increase in size down and to the left [[Periodic Trends#Atomic size|◀️]], but ions with the same number of electrons are new
- In two atoms such as $\ce{ O^{2–}, F– }$, $\ce{ F- }$ is smaller because it has more protons, these protons pull the electrons more tightly causing the atom to be smaller
- Think preschool teachers, if you have too many kids (electrons) but not enough teachers (protons) they go all over the place, but if you have few electrons but a lot of teachers, the kids can be controlled and kept in a smaller area

> [!question]- Arrange the following ions in order of decreasing size: $\ce{ Se^2–, Sr^{2+}, Rb+, and Br– }$
> $\ce{ Se^2–, Br–, Rb+, and Sr^{2+} }$, as you get more protons, it gets smaller

### Energy Effects in Binary Ionic Compounds

- Lattice energy is the change in energy that takes place when separated gaseous ions are packed together to form an ionic solid
$$
\ce{ M+(g) + X-(g) -> MX(s) }
$$
- Energy is released as ions become more stable
- To determine the lattice energy (energy released) of the formation of a ionic, one must calculate the energy of each step
$$
\ce{ Li(s) + \frac{1}{2}F2(g) -> LiF }
$$
1. Sublimation of solid lithium
$$
\ce{ Li(s) ->[\pu{ 161 kJ/mol }] Li(g) }
$$
- Remember both ions must be gas before we can pack them into solids
- It takes energy to do this though, $\pu{ 161 kJ/mol }$ to be exact. This is called Enthalpy of sublimation
1. Ionization of lithium
$$
\ce{ Li(g) ->[\pu{ 520kJ/mol }] Li+(g) + e- }
$$
- Preparing for it to bond with $\ce{ F }$
- Energy amount is found from lithium's first ionization energy
1. Dissociation of fluorine
$$
\ce{ \frac{1}{2}F2(g) ->[\pu{ 77kJ/mol }] F(g) }
$$
- We need to break the $\ce{ F2 }$ bond
- The energy to break one mol of fluorine to fluorine molecules is $\pu{ 154kJ }$ but we have half a mole of atoms so we divide by 2
1. Formation of $\ce{ F- }$ ions
$$
\ce{ F(g) + e- ->[\pu{ -328kJ/mol }] F-(g)}
$$
- Negative energy because fluorine wants to lose a electron, its more stable, energy released
1. Formation of solid lithium fluoride
$$
\ce{ Li+(g) + F-(g) ->[\pu{ -1047kJ/mol }] LiF(s) }
$$
- This number is found from the lattice energy of $\ce{ LiF }$
- Adding all the numbers together shows the overall reaction released more energy than gained
$$
161+520+77-328-1047=\pu{ -617kJ/mol }
$$

### Lewis Structures

- You remember how to do this, right [[Covalent Bonds#Lewis structures|◀️]]
- A 2 new things: atoms can have more than 8 valence electrons, and noble gases can bond

### Exceptions to the Octet Rule


- That's right, this is totally fine. But why?
- First of all, its important to note this only works for atoms in the 3rd period or lower, only these atoms can hold more than 8 electrons
- Why? Because these atoms can put the extra electrons in the next empty d orbital or as Mrs Luke likes to call it, the 'backpack'

> [!question]- Draw the lewis structure for $\ce{ PCl5 }$
>
> 

- Extra electrons should be placed on the central atom, for example $\ce{ I3– }$
![[Unit 2 2024-09-29 19.24.28.svg|Unit 2 2024-09-29 19.24.28.svg]]

### Resonance

- Same as last year [[Covalent Bonds#Resonance|◀️]], just remember the bonds are NOT alternating between the structures, they are all of them at the same time
- So the bond distance in the molecule is the average of both numbers, if the bond distance of one resonance structure is 1 and the other is 2 then the molecule has a bond distance of 1.5

#### Formal Charge

- Formal charge is calculated with this formula
$$
\pu{ FC = VE-(NB + \frac{1}{2}B) }
$$
- Pretty much, when you take a molecule, lets say $\ce{ CO2 }$

- Oxygen comes with 6 valence electrons, has 4 non bonded electrons, and 4 bonded electrons
- $6-4-2 = 0$
- It has a formal charge of 0 which is the best, anything other than 0 is bad
- Instead of doing the 4 divided by 2 you can just count the number of bonds so double bond, that's 2
- Also negative formal charge always goes on the more electronegative element

# Chapter 2

Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic. For some reason the book problems Mrs Luke linked do not cover most of the first part of this chapter so I did not spend any extra time writing summaries for them. See last year's notes as linked.

## History of Chemistry

See previous notes [[The History of Chemistry|◀️]]

## Fundamental Chemical Laws

- Antoine Lavoisier created the **law of conservation of mass** which says mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction
- Joseph Proust created the **lab of definite proportion** which says a given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass
- Dalton expanded with **the law of multiple proportions** saying when two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of the second element that combine with $1g$ of the first element can always be reduced to small whole numbers
	- In $\ce{ OH }$ $8\pu{ g }$ of oxygen is present for every $1\pu{ g }$ of hydrogen
	- *See the textbook for more info on this*

## Dalton's Atomic Theory

## An Introduction to the Periodic Table

- Most elements are metals which have these properties
	- Efficient conduction of heat and electricity
	- Malleability (can be hammered into thin sheets)
	- Ductility (can be pulled into wires)
	- Have a lustrous appearance
	- Lose electrons to form positive ions
- Nomelals have these properties
	- Tend to gain electrons in reactions with metals to form negative ions
	- Can bond to each other forming covalent bonds
- Vertical columns are called groups or families
- Horizontal rows are called periods

## Naming Simple Compounds

![[Naming flow chart.svg|Naming flow chart.svg]]

### Binary Ionic compounds

- Binary Iconic Compounds means there is two ions, a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion)
- The cation is always named first and the anion second
- If the cation, the metal is from families from 3-12 or 14 you have to use roman numerals to indicate the charge of the cation and then write the anion ending with -ide
	- For example $CuCl$ is Copper(I) chloride so that copper can balance with chlorine
- Otherwise, just write the name of the cation + the name of the anion ending with -ide
	- $NaCl$ becomes Sodium chloride

### Binary Covalent compounds

[[The History of Chemistry#Covalent compounds|◀️]]

- Binary covalent compounds contain two nonmetals
- Use prefixes on both nonmetals to indicate how many there are
- If the first one is one don't write mono
- $\ce{ NO2 }$ is Nitrogen dioxide
- $\ce{ N2O5 }$ is Dinitrogen pentoxide

### Polyatomics

![[Polyatomic Ions.svg|Polyatomic Ions.svg]]

- Assuming you memorized this graph, you can deduce many more polyatomics by looking at the oxygen atom.
- I'll use chlorate as a example.
- **per**chlor**ate**   ($\ce{ ClO4^{1-} }$)
- chlor**ate**        ($\ce{ ClO3^{1-} }$)
- chlor**ite**         ($\ce{ ClO2^{-1} }$​​​​​​​)
- **hypo**chlor**ite**  ($\ce{ ClO^{-1} }$​​​​​​​)

### Acids

![[Drawing 2024-09-08 10.39.02.svg|Drawing 2024-09-08 10.39.02.svg]]

-  "-ic" stands for the higher oxidation state (charge), and "-ous" stands for the lower oxidation state.
- This means in a ionic bond like $\ce{ Cu2O }$, the charge on $\ce{ Cu }$ is +1, this means it will be written Cupous oxide instead of $\ce{ CuO }$ which is written Cuporic oxide

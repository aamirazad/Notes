Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic.  
  
## 4.1 Introduction for Reactions  
  
- Be able to identify when a reaction takes place  
  
## 4.2 Net Ionic Equations  
  
- A chemical equation describes what is happening  
- By writing Ionics on molecular formulas, you are not explaining the full picture  
  
### Molecular  
  
- This is what we did, simple reactants products  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca(OH)2(aq) + Na2Co3(aq) -> CaCo3(s) + 2NaOH(aq) }  
$$  
  
- Pros: it tells what to mix and was results  
- Const: it does not describe what is happening at a molecular level  
  
### Complete ionic equation  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) + 2Na+(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) + 2Na+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) }  
$$  
  
- Breaks up the ionic compounds in the above reaction  
- The subscripts becomes coefficients, be careful of subscripts and coefficients  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + \cancel{ 2OH- }(aq) + \cancel{ 2Na+ }(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) + \cancel{ 2Na+ }(aq) + \cancel{ 2OH- }(aq) }  
$$  
  
- These are just by standing and nothing changes, they are the same in both sides of the reaction, called spectators  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) }  
$$  
  
- This equation, the net ionic equation which shows only the molecules that are directly related in the reaction, most likely what what you need to solve for on the ap test  
- Pros: shows exactly whats happening  
- Cons: takes a long time to write  
  
#### Practice  
  
$$  
\ce{ HClO4(aq) +Ca(OH)2(aq) -> Ca(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O }  
$$  
  
- Balance  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2HClO4(aq) +Ca(OH)2(aq) -> Ca(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O }  
$$  
  
- Separate  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2H+(aq) + 2ClO4-(aq) + Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> 2ClO4-(aq) + Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2H2O }  
$$  
  
- Remove spectators to get net ionic equation  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2H+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> H2O(l) }  
$$  
  
## 4.3 Representations of Reactions  
  
-  A particulate representation of the reaction  
- Usually shows the particles before and after the reaction, and you have to choose the picture which is correct in a mcq  
- Or draw the result of a reaction in a frq  
- Count the particles and make sure diatomic have two  
- And check the molar ratios  
  
## 4.4 Physical and Chemical Changes  
  
- Physical changes don't change the chemical makeup, phase changes [[Matter#Chemical changes|◀️]]  
- Chemical changes release gas, create or absorb heat, or form precipitate [[Matter#Chemical changes|◀️]]  
- A physical change is a change in intermolecular forces  
- Be able to explain the differences in characteristics and bond interactions of both reactions  
  
## 4.5 Stoichiometry  
  
- Know how to do balancing and limiting reagent  
- Do stoichiometry on a particulate diagram to choose which diagram correctly shows the result, don't assume everything reacts perfectly and there is no leftover even though this is not in the equation  
- From apd 3

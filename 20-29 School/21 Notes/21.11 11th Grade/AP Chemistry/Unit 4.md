# Unit 4  
  
Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic.  
  
## 4.1 Introduction for Reactions  
  
- Physical changes don't change the chemical makeup, phase changes [[Matter#Chemical changes|◀️]]  
- Chemical changes release gas, create or absorbe heat, or form precipitate [[Matter#Chemical changes|◀️]]  
  
## 4.2 Net Ionic Equations  
  
- A chemical equation describes what is happening  
- By writing Ionics on molecular formulas, you are not explaining the full picture  
  
### Molecular  
  
- This is what we did, simple reactants products  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca(OH)2(aq) + Na2Co3(aq) -> CaCo3(s) + 2NaOH(aq) }  
$$  
  
- Pros: it tells what to mix and was results  
- Const: it does not describe what is happening at a molecular level  
  
### Complete ionic equation  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) + 2Na+(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) + 2Na+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) }  
$$  
  
- Breaks up the ionic compounds in the above reaction  
- The subscripts becomes coefficients, be careful of subscripts and coefficients  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + \cancel{ 2OH- }(aq) + \cancel{ 2Na+ }(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) + \cancel{ 2Na+ }(aq) + \cancel{ 2OH- }(aq) }  
$$  
  
- These are just by standing and nothing changes, they are the same in both sides of the reaction, called spectators  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) }  
$$  
  
- This equation, the net ionic equation which shows only the molecules that are directly related in the reaction, most likely what what you need to solve for on the ap test  
- Pros: shows exactly whats happening  
- Cons: takes a long time to write  
  
#### Practice  
  
$$  
\ce{ HClO4(aq) +Ca(OH)2(aq) -> Ca(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O }  
$$  
  
- Balance  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2HClO4(aq) +Ca(OH)2(aq) -> Ca(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O }  
$$  
  
- Separate  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2H+(aq) + 2ClO4-(aq) + Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> 2ClO4-(aq) + Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2H2O }  
$$  
  
- Remove spectators to get net ionic equation  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2H+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> H2O(l) }  
$$

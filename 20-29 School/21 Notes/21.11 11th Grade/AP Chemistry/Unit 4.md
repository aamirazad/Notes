# Unit 4  
  
Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic.  
  
## 4.1 Introduction for Reactions  
  
- Be able to identify when a reaction takes place  
  
## 4.2 Net Ionic Equations  
  
- A chemical equation describes what is happening  
- By writing Ionics on molecular formulas, you are not explaining the full picture  
  
### Molecular  
  
- This is what we did, simple reactants products  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca(OH)2(aq) + Na2Co3(aq) -> CaCo3(s) + 2NaOH(aq) }  
$$  
  
- Pros: it tells what to mix and was results  
- Const: it does not describe what is happening at a molecular level  
  
### Complete ionic equation  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) + 2Na+(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) + 2Na+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) }  
$$  
  
- Breaks up the ionic compounds in the above reaction  
- The subscripts becomes coefficients, be careful of subscripts and coefficients  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + \cancel{ 2OH- }(aq) + \cancel{ 2Na+ }(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) + \cancel{ 2Na+ }(aq) + \cancel{ 2OH- }(aq) }  
$$  
  
- These are just by standing and nothing changes, they are the same in both sides of the reaction, called spectators  
  
$$  
\ce{ Ca^{+2}(aq) + CO3^{-2}(aq) -> CaCO3(s) }  
$$  
  
- This equation, the net ionic equation which shows only the molecules that are directly related in the reaction, most likely what what you need to solve for on the ap test  
- Pros: shows exactly whats happening  
- Cons: takes a long time to write  
  
#### Practice  
  
$$  
\ce{ HClO4(aq) +Ca(OH)2(aq) -> Ca(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O }  
$$  
  
- Balance  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2HClO4(aq) +Ca(OH)2(aq) -> Ca(ClO4)2(aq) + H2O }  
$$  
  
- Separate  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2H+(aq) + 2ClO4-(aq) + Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> 2ClO4-(aq) + Ca^{+2}(aq) + 2H2O }  
$$  
  
- Remove spectators to get net ionic equation  
  
$$  
\ce{ 2H+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> H2O(l) }  
$$  
  
## 4.3 Representations of Reactions  
  
-  A particulate representation of the reaction  
- Usually shows the particles before and after the reaction, and you have to choose the picture which is correct in a mcq  
- Or draw the result of a reaction in a frq  
- Count the particles and make sure diatomic have two  
- And check the molar ratios  
  
## 4.4 Physical and Chemical Changes  
  
- Physical changes don't change the chemical makeup, phase changes [[Matter#Chemical changes|◀️]]  
- Chemical changes release gas, create or absorb heat, or form precipitate [[Matter#Chemical changes|◀️]]  
- A physical change is a change in intermolecular forces  
- Be able to explain the differences in characteristics and bond interactions of both reactions  
  
## 4.5 Stoichiometry  
  
- Know how to do balancing and limiting reagent  
- Do stoichiometry on a particulate diagram to choose which diagram correctly shows the result, don't assume everything reacts perfectly and there is no leftover even though this is not in the equation  
- From apd 3

## 4.6 Introduction to Titration  
  
[[Acids and Bases#Titration|◀️]]  
  
- A titration curve shows the progression as the titrant is (solution being dripped) reacting with the analyte (unknown in the flask)  
- The middle of the part with the most change in distance is the equivalence point, the point when it changes color  
- From apd 1  
  
> [!question] In a separate experimental procedure, the student titrates $10.0 \pu{ mL }$ of the $\ce{ 2.000 M HC2H3O9(aq) }$ with an $\ce{ NaOH(aq) }$ solution of unknown concentration. The student monitors the pH during the titration. The following titration curve was created using the experimental data presented in the table.

> > $$\ce{ \frac{0.02\pu{ mol }NaOH}{0.014L} = 1.43M NaOH } $$  
  
## 4.7 Types of Chemical Reactions  
  
### Acid base reaction  
  
[[Acids and Bases|◀️]]  
- Brønsted–Lowry acids donate a $\ce{ H+ }$ while a Brønsted–Lowry base receives a $\ce{ H+ }$  
$$  
\rlap{\overbracket{\phantom{ NH_{3}U + H_{2}O \to NH_{4}^{+} }}^{\text{Base} \to \text{Conjugate Acid}}}NH_{3}U + \underbracket{H_{2}O \to NH_{4}^{+}+OH^-}_{\text{Acid} \to \text{Conjugate Base}}  
$$  
  
### Oxidation-redox reaction  
  
- OIL RIG  
- **O**xidation **i**s **l**oss of electrions **r**eduction **i**s **g**ain of electrons  
- To keep track of the location of these electrons we use oxidation numbers  
- Atoms on their own have the oxidation number that is the same as their charge so regular $\ce{ H2, Fe, O2 }$ all have oxidation numbers of 0 and $\ce{ Li+ }$ has +1, $\ce{ Br- }$ has -1, and $\ce{ Mg+2 }$ has +2  
- Oxygen in a compound is almost always -2, Hydrogen is usually +1 when bonded with a nonmetal and Florine always has -1  
- The sum of oxidation numbers in a compound must equal the charge of the compound  
  
### Precipitate Reaction  
  
- Mixing aqueous ions to form a precipitate, insoluble ionic compounds  
- **SNAP (Sodium, nitrogen, ammonium, and potassium) are always soluble even with the big bads**  
- **Big bads are lead, silver, or mucary**  
- Chloride, bromide, and iodide are usually soluble if it is not with the big bads  
- Most sulfates are soluble except with barium, calcium and big bads  
- When telling deciding which type of reaction it is, first look for the formation of a precipitate, then a transfer of $\ce{ H }+$ ions, then assign oxidation numbers

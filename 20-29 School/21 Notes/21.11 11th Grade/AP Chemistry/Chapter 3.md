## Atomic Masses

[[Mass Relations in Chemistry#Atomic masses|◀️]]

- This is a mass spectrometer, you probably should be able to identify this on the AP test
- How it works is you have a bunch of different isotopes on the left part an then zap them with electrons which knock electrons off of them causing them to switch to positives ions accelerating them to a magnetic field, depending on how far it travels is the relative weight of that isotope

- From this, you graph the values and get this

- To interpret it, first find the most abundant isotope
- In this case that would be 24, and then estimate where the center of the data would lie
- Its obviously not 24 or 26 and its probably not 25 because there would be much more on the left than the right so it is probably a little off to the right of 24 but not on 25
- Looking at the period table $\ce{ Mg }$ with a atomic mass of $24.305$ would make the most sense to be our atom
- There is also a calculation you can do for this as well which involves taking the percents of each isotope and multiplying it by the mass and adding that for all of the isotopes [[Mass Relations in Chemistry#Using abundance|◀️]]

## The mole

[[Mass Relations in Chemistry#Mole|◀️]]

- Its easy to forget a mole is just the number of carbon atoms in exactly $12g$ of pure carbon.
- Its just a number which can represents $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ units of that substance
- Molar mass is the number of those atoms, in moles, to make 1 gram of that substance
- This is easy stuff right? Lets do a practice problem to make sure

> [!question]- A silicon chip is used in an integrated circuit of a microcomputer has a mass of $\pu{ 5.68mg }$. How many silicon ($\ce{ Si }$) atoms are present in the chip
> $$
> \pu{ 5.68\cancel{ mg } Si }C \times \frac{\pu{ 1\cancel{ g } Si }}{\pu{ 1000\cancel{ mg } Si }} \times \frac{\pu{ 1 \cancel{ mol } Si }}{\pu{ 28.085\cancel{ g } Si }} \times \frac{\pu{ 6.02 \times 10^{23} atoms}}{\pu{ 1 \cancel{ mol } Si }} = \pu{ 1.25\times10^{20} atoms }

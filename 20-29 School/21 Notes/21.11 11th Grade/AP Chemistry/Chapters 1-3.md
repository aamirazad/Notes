Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic

## Chapter 1

### The Scientific Method

#### Theory

[[Matter#Theory|◀️]]

- A theory is a set of tested hypotheses that gives a **explanation** of a phenomenon
- Explain **WHY** an event occurs

#### Law

[[Matter#Law|◀️]]

- A law is a summery of observed behavior (Law of conservation of mass)
- Theory are created by humans as a educated guess as to why a law happens

#### Experiment

- A theory is a explanation as to why a law exists and is proven to be true after many experiments
- A experiment is a controlled test to see if a given hypothesis is true
- A **experiment** proves a **theory** to be the correct explanation to a **law**

#### Hypothesis

- A hypothesis is a possible explanation to a law while a theory is the results of many tested hypothesis

### Units of Measurement

- See [[Measurement#Units|◀️ Notes of Measurement]]

### Uncertainty in Measurement

- Know the [[Measurement#Significant figures|◀️ rules]]
- Accuracy is how close the measurement value is to the true value and Precision is how consistent the measured value is [[Measurement#Precision and accuracy|◀️]]
### Percent error

$$
\frac{\text{Value accepted} \cdot \text{Value experimental}}{\text{Value accepted}} \cdot 100\%
$$

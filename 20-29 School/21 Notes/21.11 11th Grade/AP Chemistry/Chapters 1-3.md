# Chapters 1-3

Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic

## Chapter 1

### The Scientific Method

#### Theory

[[Matter#Theory|◀️]]

- A theory is a set of tested hypotheses that gives a **explanation** of a phenomenon
- Explain **WHY** an event occurs

#### Law

[[Matter#Law|◀️]]

- A law is a summery of observed behavior (Law of conservation of mass)
- Theory are created by humans as a educated guess as to why a law happens

#### Experiment

- A theory is a explanation as to why a law exists and is proven to be true after many experiments
- A experiment is a controlled test to see if a given hypothesis is true
- A **experiment** proves a **theory** to be the correct explanation to a **law**

#### Hypothesis

- A hypothesis is a possible explanation to a law while a theory is the results of many tested hypothesis

### Units of Measurement

- See [[Measurement#Units|◀️ Notes of Measurement]]

### Uncertainty in Measurement

- Know the [[Measurement#Significant figures|◀️ rules]]
- Accuracy is how close the measurement value is to the true value and Precision is how consistent the measured value is [[Measurement#Precision and accuracy|◀️]]
### Percent error

$$
\frac{\text{Value accepted} \cdot \text{Value experimental}}{\text{Value accepted}} \cdot 100\%
$$



### Dimensional Analysis

[[Measurement#Dimensional analysis|◀️]]

> [!question]- You are driving 65 miles/hour and take your eyes off the road for “just a second.” What distance (in feet) do you travel in this time?
> $$1\pu{ \text{second} } \times \frac{1\pu{ \text{minute} }}{60\pu{ \text{seconds}}} \times \frac{1\pu{ \text{hour} }}{60\pu{ \text{minutes} }} \times \frac{65\pu{ \text{miles} }}{1\pu{ \text{hour} }} \times \frac{5280\pu{ ft }}{1\pu{ \text{mile} }} = 100\pu{ ft }$$
> *Remember significant figures*

### Temperature

- To go from Kelvin to Celsius subtract 273

> [!question]- Normal body temperature is $37 \pu{ \degree C }$. Covert this temperature to Kelvin
> $$37 \pu{ \degree C } + 273 = 310\pu{ K } = 310\pu{ K }$$

### Density

$$
\text{ Density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{ volume}}
$$

> [!question]- In the opening scenes of the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and an unscrupulous guide play catch with a gold idol (Density of gold=19.32 g/cm3; density of sand approx. = 2.g/cm3) Assume that the volume of the idol is about 1 L. If it were solid gold, what mass would the idol have? Is playing catch with it plausible?
> $$
> 1\pu{ L } \times \frac{1000\pu{ mL }}{1\pu{ L }} \times \frac{19.32\pu{ g }}{1\pu{ mL }} \times \frac{1\pu{ lb }}{434\pu{ g }} = 40\pu{ lb }\text{not plausible}

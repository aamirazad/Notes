# Unit 1

Click on the back emoji ◀️ to be linked to last year's notes that affirm the topic. For some reason the book problems Mrs Luke linked do not cover most of the first part of this chapter so I did not spend any extra time writing summaries for them. See last year's notes as linked.

## Chapter 1

### The Scientific Method

#### Theory

[[Matter#Theory|◀️]]

- A theory is a set of tested hypotheses that gives a **explanation** of a phenomenon
- Explain **WHY** an event occurs

#### Law

[[Matter#Law|◀️]]

- A law is a summery of observed behavior (Law of conservation of mass)
- Theory are created by humans as a educated guess as to why a law happens

#### Experiment

- A theory is a explanation as to why a law exists and is proven to be true after many experiments
- A experiment is a controlled test to see if a given hypothesis is true
- A **experiment** proves a **theory** to be the correct explanation to a **law**

#### Hypothesis

- A hypothesis is a possible explanation to a law while a theory is the results of many tested hypothesis

### Units of Measurement

- See [[Measurement#Units|◀️ Notes of Measurement]]

### Uncertainty in Measurement

- Know the [[Measurement#Significant figures|◀️ rules]]
- Accuracy is how close the measurement value is to the true value and Precision is how consistent the measured value is [[Measurement#Precision and accuracy|◀️]]
### Percent error

$$
\frac{\text{Value accepted} - \text{Value experimental}}{\text{Value accepted}} \cdot 100\%
$$



### Dimensional Analysis

[[Measurement#Dimensional analysis|◀️]]

> [!question]- You are driving 65 miles/hour and take your eyes off the road for “just a second.” What distance (in feet) do you travel in this time?
> $$
> 1\pu{ \text{second} } \times \frac{1\pu{ \text{minute} }}{60\pu{ \text{seconds}}} \times \frac{1\pu{ \text{hour} }}{60\pu{ \text{minutes} }} \times \frac{65\pu{ \text{miles} }}{1\pu{ \text{hour} }} \times \frac{5280\pu{ ft }}{1\pu{ \text{mile} }} = 100\pu{ ft }
> $$
> *Remember significant figures*

### Temperature

- To go from Kelvin to Celsius subtract 273

> [!question]- Normal body temperature is $37 \pu{ \degree C }$. Covert this temperature to Kelvin
> $$
> 37 \pu{ \degree C } + 273 = 310\pu{ K } = 310\pu{ K }
> $$

### Density

$$
\text{ Density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{ volume}}
$$

> [!question]- In the opening scenes of the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and an unscrupulous guide play catch with a gold idol (Density of gold=19.32 g/cm3; density of sand approx. = 2.g/cm3) Assume that the volume of the idol is about 1 L. If it were solid gold, what mass would the idol have? Is playing catch with it plausible?
> $$
> 1\pu{ L } \times \frac{1000\pu{ mL }}{1\pu{ L }} \times \frac{19.32\pu{ g }}{1\pu{ mL }} \times \frac{1\pu{ lb }}{434\pu{ g }} = 40\pu{ lb }\text{not plausible}
> $$

### Classification of Matter

- A **Solid** [[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Solid properties|◀️]] has a fixed volume and shape
- A **Liquid** [[Liquids, Solids, and Solutions#Liquid properties|◀️]] has a definite volume but no specific shape
- A **Gas** doesn't have a fixed volume or shape
- A **mixture** [[Matter#Mixtures|◀️]] has at least two different types of matter that can be separated
	- A **homogeneous** mixture is perfectly mixed and the parts are indistinguishable (soup)
		- A homogeneous mixture is called a **solution**
	- A **heterogeneous** mixture has visible distinguishable parts (salad)
- A **pure substance** [[Matter#Pure substances|◀️]] has constant composition
	- Pure water is a pure substance—even though $\ce{ H2O }$ has multiple elements—while seawater is a mixture because it has many pure substances in it which can be separated physically while the $\ce{ H }$ in $\ce{ H2O }$ has to be separated chemically
- Review the methods to [[Matter#Separation of mixtures|◀️ separate mixtures]] physically

> [!question] When each of the following is heated to $50\degree C$ and the temperature is held constant for 5 minutes, which one undergoes *only* a physical change
> - (A) Egg
> - (B) Steak
> - (C) Ice Cream
> - (D) Cake batter
>
> > [!answer]- Answer
> > C, liquid to solid is not a chemical change

## Chapter 2

### History of Chemistry

See previous notes [[The History of Chemistry|◀️]]

### Fundamental Chemical Laws

- Antoine Lavoisier created the **law of conservation of mass** which says mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction
- Joseph Proust created the **lab of definite proportion** which says a given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass
- Dalton expanded with **the law of multiple proportions** saying when two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of the second element that combine with $1g$ of the first element can always be reduced to small whole numbers
	- In $\ce{ OH }$ $8\pu{ g }$ of oxygen is present for every $1\pu{ g }$ of hydrogen
	- *See the textbook for more info on this*

### Dalton's Atomic Theory

- See previous notes [[The History of Chemistry#Atomic theories timeline|◀️]]

### Early Experiments to Characterize the Atom

- See previous notes [[The History of Chemistry#Drawings|◀️]]

### An Introduction to the Periodic Table

- Most elements are metals which have these properties
	- Efficient conduction of heat and electricity
	- Malleability (can be hammered into thin sheets)
	- Ductility (can be pulled into wires)
	- Have a lustrous appearance
	- Lose electrons to form positive ions
- Nonmelals have these properties
	- Tend to gain electrons in reactions with metals to form negative ions
	- Can bond to each other forming covalent bonds
- Vertical columns are called groups or families
- Horizontal rows are called periods

### Naming Simple Compounds

![[Naming flow chart.svg|Naming flow chart.svg]]

#### Binary Ionic compounds

- Binary Iconic Compounds means there is two ions, a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion)
- The cation is always named first and the anion second
- If the cation, the metal is from families from 3-12 or 14 you have to use roman numerals to indicate the charge of the cation and then write the anion ending with -ide
	- For example $CuCl$ is Copper(I) chloride so that copper can balance with chlorine
- Otherwise, just write the name of the cation + the name of the anion ending with -ide
	- $NaCl$ becomes Sodium chloride

#### Binary Covalent compounds

[[The History of Chemistry#Covalent compounds|◀️]]

- Binary covalent compounds contain two nonmetals
- Use prefixes on both nonmetals to indicate how many there are
- If the first one is one don't write mono
- $\ce{ NO2 }$ is Nitrogen dioxide
- $\ce{ N2O5 }$ is Dinitrogen pentoxide

#### Polyatomics

![[Polyatomic Ions.svg|Polyatomic Ions.svg]]

- Assuming you memorized this graph, you can deduce many more polyatomics by looking at the oxygen atom.
- I'll use chlorate as a example.
- **per**chlor**ate**   ($\ce{ ClO4^{1-} }$)
- chlor**ate**        ($\ce{ ClO3^{1-} }$)
- chlor**ite**         ($\ce{ ClO2^{-1} }$​​​​​​​)
- **hypo**chlor**ite**  ($\ce{ ClO^{-1} }$​​​​​​​)

#### Acids

![[Drawing 2024-09-08 10.39.02.svg|Drawing 2024-09-08 10.39.02.svg]]

-  "-ic" stands for the higher oxidation state (charge), and "-ous" stands for the lower oxidation state.
- This means in a ionic bond like $\ce{ Cu2O }$, the charge on $\ce{ Cu }$ is +1, this means it will be written Cupous oxide instead of $\ce{ CuO }$ which is written Cuporic oxide

### Atomic Masses

[[Mass Relations in Chemistry#Atomic masses|◀️]]

- This is a mass spectrometer, you probably should be able to identify this on the AP test
- How it works is you have a bunch of different isotopes on the left part an then zap them with electrons which knock electrons off of them causing them to switch to positives ions accelerating them to a magnetic field, depending on how far it travels is the relative weight of that isotope

![Mass spectrometer](https://link.storjshare.io/s/jv3owgwgohxhailzmlghgjppo3nq/share/2024-09-09T19:29-04:00-mass-spectrometer.webp?wrap=0)

- From this, you graph the values and get this

![Mass spectrum](https://link.storjshare.io/s/jv3owgwgohxhailzmlghgjppo3nq/share/2024-09-09T20:39:14-04:00-mass-spectrum.webp?wrap=0)


- To interpret it, first find the most abundant isotope
- In this case that would be 24, and then estimate where the center of the data would lie
- Its obviously not 24 or 26 and its probably not 25 because there would be much more on the left than the right so it is probably a little off to the right of 24 but not on 25
- Looking at the period table $\ce{ Mg }$ with a atomic mass of $24.305$ would make the most sense to be our atom
- There is also a calculation you can do for this as well which involves taking the percents of each isotope and multiplying it by the mass and adding that for all of the isotopes [[Mass Relations in Chemistry#Using abundance|◀️]]

### The mole

[[Mass Relations in Chemistry#Mole|◀️]]

- Its easy to forget a mole is just the number of carbon atoms in exactly $12g$ of pure carbon.
- Its just a number which can represents $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ units of that substance
- Molar mass is the number of those atoms, in moles, to make 1 gram of that substance
- This is easy stuff right? Lets do a practice problem to make sure

> [!question]- A silicon chip is used in an integrated circuit of a microcomputer has a mass of $\pu{ 5.68mg }$. How many silicon ($\ce{ Si }$) atoms are present in the chip
> $$
> \pu{ 5.68\cancel{ mg } Si }C \times \frac{\pu{ 1\cancel{ g } Si }}{\pu{ 1000\cancel{ mg } Si }} \times \frac{\pu{ 1 \cancel{ mol } Si }}{\pu{ 28.085\cancel{ g } Si }} \times \frac{\pu{ 6.02 \times 10^{23} atoms}}{\pu{ 1 \cancel{ mol } Si }} = \pu{ 1.25\times10^{20} atoms }

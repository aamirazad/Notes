# Wilson's Peace Plan  
  
- Fourteen points  
    - No secret treaties among nations  
    - Freedom of the seas maintained  
        - This is because of the u boat attacks  
    - Tariffs lowered or abolished to promote free trade  
    - Reduction of arms  
    - Consider interest of those living in colonies  
        - Do they want to be a part of the country?  
        - These conflicts lead to war  
    - Dealt with boundary lines, which were set up among ethnic groups  
    - League of nations  
        - Most important one  
        - A place for countries to discuss their problems, so they don't have to go to war  
        - But this never comes to be  
  
## Allies reject plan  
  
- Four countries went to versailles to decide on the plan  
- _Need to know the countries_  
- French Premier - Clemenceau  
- British PM - David Lloyd pay  
- US - Wilson _(double check this one)_  
- Meetings did not include the Central Powers  
- Since the other countries wanted vengeance, Wilson ended up conceding on most of the 14 points  
- Boundary lines are moved and the ottoman empires are broken up  
    - Russia loses a lot of land, they are not happy about this  
  
## Repercussions of Treaty  
  
- Banned Germany from maintaining an army  
    - They had been seen as an aggressor  
- Alsace - Lorraine was a piece of land that France had lost at another war, Germany had to give it bac  
- War reparations  
    - The biggest one  
    - The Allies make Germany pay for the total cost of the war ($33 billion)  
    - We joined the war because we wanted our money back from the Allies, so for the Allies to get the money to pay us back, we make germany pay the Allies so they can pay us back  
  
  
## Debating the treaty  
  
- Low ability for a lasting peace because of the treatment of Germany  
- War guilt clause made germany admit to causing the war  
- Germany was stripped of all their colonies which they could have used to pay the debt  
- Russia was determined to regain lost territory, the area of countries known as the USSR  
  
  
## Debate over treaty at home  
  
- US Senate did not approve of the League of Nations  
    - They did not like the idea of the US policing the world  
- Wilson tries to convince them but has a stroke and the Senate never agrees  
  
  
## WW1 Legacy  
  
- The war strengthened military and government power  
- Social change for women and african americans  
- Social and political systems damaged throughout Europe  
- Times were very prosperous here, we got toothpaste and other stuff  
- Europe wss not the same  
- Germany was not doing the same  
- They could not pay back the loan, but we wanted them to  
- So we pay germany so they could pay the allies, so they can pay us back  
- But we had to stop paying them during the depression _double check this_  
- Majority of germans were poor so when Hitler talked at local pubs, and he was a good speakers  
- When something was wrong, you usually try to find something to blame  
- Hitler game someone to blame  
- Stereotypes of Jewish people: they were smart, hord money, bankers  
- So hitler pinpoints the jewish, he says most people are poor, but the Jewish are not poor, because they control the banks, so they should blame the banks  
- Hitler then believed he needs his own military (the government wasn't allowed to have a military) but he was not the military

# America Tips the Balance of Power  
  
- We join and pass the Selective Service Act (1917) which is a draft to randomly select for military service  
- 24 million had registered with 3 million called to service  
- America was not very prepared and our military wasn't that great, we didn't just come in and finish up the war  
  
- Uncle sam and other propaganda tried to get people to sign up  
- We started losing so many men that we start using women, Rosy was the women's version of uncle sam to get them to help the military in non fighting ways like factories      
- Because of the u boats, government took over the production of ships  
- To combat u boats, Admiral William Sims introduced the convoy system  
- Americans brought french bodies and enthusiasm to the exhausted Allied troops, people who hadn't been fighting for 3 years  
- Our fighting force which went to europe was called the American Expeditionary Force, soldiers were called doughboys  
- They were shocked by the battlefield horror and new weaponry  
  
## Technology  
  
- The technology was much more advanced than previous wars  
- Machine guns increased firepower to 600 rounds per minute  
- Tanks were used to mow down barbed wires and soldiers  
- Poison gas, mustard, chlorine, suffocated burned and blinded victims, gas masks were needed  
- Airships and airplanes could have machine guns for dogfights or fights in the air  
- Floating zeppelins gas filled airplanes  
- Shell Shock was the complete emotional collapse of soldiers (this is like PTSD now)  
- Trench Foot occurred as men were standing all day without changing boots or socks  
- Austria Hungary surrendered on November 3, 1918  
- The armistice (truce) was signed to end the war on November 11, 1918  
  
## Final Toll  
  
- 22 million deaths, half of which were civilian  
- 10 million wounded  
- 338 billion dollars  
- 48,000 american deaths in battle  
- 62,000 american deaths to disease  
    - This is from cross contamination from germs and meet  
    - And STDs  
    - Spread from using the same materials in the hospitals  
    - Penicillin comes up and saves many lives from reducing disease and STDs  
  
## Overall  
  
- America got in the war because we wanted our money back  
- The spark was the assassination of Fredick

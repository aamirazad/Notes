# Nomenclature Review

## How To Speak Chemistrian by CrashCourse

### Naming acids

- Prefixes and suffixes are based on how many oxygen atoms it has
- All anions that end in "-ate" form acids that end with "-ic"; ATE ions become IC acids
- See [[Polyatomic Ions|Polyatomic Ions]], Most end in "-ate"
- Further, all atoms that end in "-ite" form acids that end in "-ous"; ITE ions become OUS ACIDS
- Hypo prefix means less oxygen (than the anion)


| **Number of atoms**  | Acid prefix/suffix | Anion prefix/suffix |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **1 more than -ic**  | Per- / -ic         | Per- / -ate         |
| **-ic acid**         | -ic                | -Ate                |
| **1 fewer than -ic** | -ous               | -Ite                |
| **2 fewer than -ic** | Hypo- / -ous       | Hypo- / -Ite        |
| **No oxygen**        | Hyrdo- / -ic       | -Ide                |

## Naming Covalent Molecular Compounds by Tyler DeWitt

- Nonmetal + nonmetals (both on the right side of the staircase) form covalent bonds
- This is not ionic bonds which are caused by left (metal) bonding with right (nonmetal)
1. For the first element, start with the element name
2. For the second element, start with the -ide name
3. Use prefixes to show how many atoms of each type there are
- $\ce{ N2O3 }$
- *di*nitrogen *tri*oxxide

> [!question]- Name of $\ce{ P4S10 }$?
> *Tetra*phosphorus *deca*sulfide

1. Do not use mono for the first element

> [!question]- Name of $\ce{ CF4 }$?
> Carbon *tetra*fluoride
> Not monocarbon

> [!question]- Name of $\ce{ PCl5 }$
> Phosphorus *penta*chloride

1. If you have "ao" or "oo", turn it into "o"

> [!question]- Name of $\ce{ Cl2O_{7} }$?
> *Di*clorine *hept*oxide

- This rule doesn't apply to the double "i" in $\ce{ NI3 }$

> [!question]- Name of $\ce{ P4O6 }$?
> *Tetra*phosphorus *hex*oxide

> [!question]- Name of $\ce{ CO }$
> Carbon *mon*oxide

### Recap of the rules

1. For the first element, start with the element name
2. For the second element, start with the -ide name
3. Use prefixes to show how many atoms of each type there are
4. Do not use mono for the first element
5. If you have "ao" or "oo", turn it into "o"

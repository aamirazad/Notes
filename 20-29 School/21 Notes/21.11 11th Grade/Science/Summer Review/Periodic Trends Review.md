## Electron affinity

- A neutral atom's likelihood of gaining an electron
- When an electron is added to a neutral atom (i.e., first electron affinity) energy is released; thus, the first electron affinities are **negative**. However, more energy is required to add an electron to a negative ion (i.e., second electron affinity) which overwhelms any the release of energy from the electron attachment process and hence, second electron affinities are **positive**.
- Notice that electron affinity decreases down the family or group

# Integrating Textual Evidence

### Common pitfalls

- In the text it states
- 3 lines of text

### Romeo and Juliet: Literature example

- Comes after a solid topic sentence that points the render where the evidence is from
	- In scene 5, act 1, Shakespeare presents Tybalt's outrage… to show tybalt is loyal
- Textual Evidence
	- Tybalt says "Fetch my rapier boy…", "He is a Montague, our foe" shows Tybalt's anger
- How to integrate this evidence into the paper without just dropping it in
- 3 ways to integrate textual evidence
- Don't say in the text it says, the text doesn't speak

### Tunna fish sandwich

- Long quotes is like putting a lot of tuna fish on a sandwich making it, all soggy
- So you need to drain the tuna fish (quote) for only the meat
- In the Tybalt quote find only the parts that support that tybalt is loyal
	- "Fetch my rapier ~~boy~~"
- Same idea for Rhetorical, just the part that supports the topic

### Channel Elsa\

- To integrate the quote you need to write the quote in your language you need to "Let it flow"
- The part that you write should flow into the quote and then through the gaps and then the end
- Tybalt directs his servant to "fetch my rapier" as he contemplates…
- Another example
	- so  "no one has the right to take it" no matter how "just the reasoning may be"
Cant tell where the quotes are

### A visit from your foreign friend Dog Mar

- Dog Mar is gonna leave but you are going to a party so you bring Dog More but he isn't invited and everyone will be awkward
- But if you explain why dog mar is there they will then accept him, plus if you talk about how cool Dog More is, they will be so interested (citation)
- Bring a foreign quote, explain why its there taking credit for how cool he is, and then give credit by explaining where its from

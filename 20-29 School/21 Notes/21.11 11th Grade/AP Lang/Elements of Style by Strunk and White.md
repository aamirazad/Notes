# Elements of Style by Strunk and White

### Introduction

- Instructions like a sergeant giving instructions:
	- "Do not join independent clauses with a comma." ([[#^Rule-5|Rule 5.]])
	- "Use active voice." ([[#^Rule-14|Rule 14.]])
	- "Omit needless words!" ([[#^Rule-17|Rule 17.]])
- The times had a headline: `Charles' Tonsils out.` But [[#^Rule-1|Rule 1.]] says to form possessive singular of nouns by adding `'s` no matter the final consonant
- Style rules are a bit of a matter of preference

### Chapter 1 - Elementary Rules of Usage

#### Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's ^Rule-1

Form the possessive singular of nouns
by adding `'s`. Follow this whatever the final constant is

##### Exceptions

- Ancient proper names ending in `-es` or `-is`
	- `Jesus'`
	- `Moses' Laws`
	- `Isis' Temple`
		- Though this is commonly written as the temple of Isis
- Pronominal Possessives `hers`, `its`, `theirs`, `yours`, and `ours`
	- `Its bag`
	- `It is hers`

#### In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last ^Rule-2

Series of three or more terms with single
conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

- `Red, white, and blue`
- Business names are written as they choose
	- `Little, Brown and Company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette`

#### Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas ^Rule-3

- `The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.`
- If the interruption is slight, commas can be omitted, otherwise commas should wrap the interruption
- Make sure you add it to both sides
- Abbreviations, titles, times and places
	- `If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.`
	- `Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided.`

##### Exceptions

- Restrictive term of identifications
	- `Billy the kid`
- Jr. abbreviation is restrictive
	- `James Wright Jr.`
- Clauses introduced by `which`, `when`, and `where` are nonrestrictive, don't limit or define anything in the sentence, so they should be separated into two sentences
	- `Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.`
- Restrictive clauses, on the other hand, are not parenthetic
	- `People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.`
- Clauses introduced by `who` cannot be split, follow the original rules
	- `Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward`
	- `My cousin Bob is a talented harpist`

#### Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause ^Rule-4

- `The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape`

#### Do not join independent clauses with a comma. ^Rule-5

- Use a semicolon
	- `It is nearly half past five: we cannot much town before dark.`
- Or comma, see [[#^Rule-4|rule 4]]
- Even if a adverb is used to bridge, a semicolon is still needed
	- `I had never been in the place before; besides, it has dark as a tomb.`

#### Do not break sentences into two ^Rule-6

- Don't use periods for commas
	- `She has a interesting taker. A woman who had traveled all over the world`

##### Exceptions

- Emphatic word or expression
	- `Again one again be called out. No reply`

#### Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation ^Rule-7

- Usually follows an independent clause
- Not `Your dedicated whittler requires: a knife, a price of wood, and a back porch.`
- Should be `Your dedicated whittler requires three props: a knife, a piece of wood, and a back porch`
- Join the independent clauses with a colon if the second intercepts or amplify the first
- `But even so, there was a directness and dispatch about animal burial: there was no stopover in the undertaker's foul parlor, no wreath or spray.`
- A colon may introduce a quotation that supports or contributes to the preceding clause
	- `The squalor of the streets reminded her of a line from Oscar Wilde: "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."`

#### Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary ^Rule-8

- A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a common less
formal than a colon, more relaxed than parentheses
- `His first thought on getting out of bed — if he had any thought at all — was to get back in again`

#### The number of the subject determines the number of the verb ^Rule-9

- Words that intervene between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.
	- `The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials,its joys, its adventures, its challenges — is not soon forgotten.`
	- The youth is the subject and thus it should be `is` not `are` not soon forgotten
- `Each`, `either`, `everyone`, `everybody`, `neither`, `nobody`, and `someone` are singular
	- `Everybody thinks he has a unique sense of humor` (`thinks` instead of `think`)
- A compound subject, formed by two ore more nouns joined by and, require a plural verb
	- `The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand`
- Except for compounds that are a unit and subjects connected by `each` or
`every`
	- `Bread and butter was all she served` (`was` instead of `were`)
- Be careful of nouns that end with a `s` which appear to be plural even though they are singular
	- `The Republican Headquarters is on this side of the tracks`

#### Use the proper case of pronoun ^Rule-10

- `We heavy eaters would rather walk than ride.`\
- `Who knocks?`
- In general, avoid "understood" verbs
	- Not `I think Horace admires Jessica more than I.`
	- Should be `I think Horace admires Jessica more than I do.`
-

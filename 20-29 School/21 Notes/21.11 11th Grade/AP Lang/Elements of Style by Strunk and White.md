# Elements of Style by Strunk and White

### Introduction

- Instructions like a sergeant giving instructions:
	- "Do not join independent clauses with a comma." ([[#Rule 5 Do not join independent clauses with a comma|Rule 5.]])
	- "Use active voice." ([[#Rule 4 Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause|Rule 14.]])
	- "Omit needless words!" (Rule 17.)
- The times had a headline: `Charles' Tonsils out.` But [[#Rule 1 Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's|Rule 1]]. says to form possessive singular of nouns by adding `'s` no matter the final consonant
- Style rules are a bit of a matter of preference

### Chapter 1: Elementary Rules of Usage

#### Rule 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's

Form the possessive singular of nouns
by adding `'s`. Follow this whatever the final constant is

##### Exceptions

- Ancient proper names ending in `-es` or `-is`
	- `Jesus'`
	- `Moses' Laws`
	- `Isis' Temple`
		- Though this is commonly written as the temple of Isis
- Pronominal Possessives `hers`, `its`, `theirs`, `yours`, and `ours`
	- `Its bag`
	- `It is hers`

#### Rule 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

Series of three or more terms with single
conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

- `Red, white, and blue`
- Business names are written as they choose
	- `Little, Brown and Company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette`

#### Rule 3: Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas

- `The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.`
- If the interruption is slight, commas can be omitted, otherwise commas should wrap the interruption
- Make sure you add it to both sides
- Abbreviations, titles, times and places
	- `If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.`
	- `Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided.`

##### Exceptions

- Restrictive term of identifications
	- `Billy the kid`
- Jr. abbreviation is restrictive
	- `James Wright Jr.`
- Clauses introduced by `which`, `when`, and `where` are nonrestrictive, don't limit or define anything in the sentence, so they should be separated into two sentences
	- `Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.`
- Restrictive clauses, on the other hand, are not parenthetic
	- `People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.`
- Clauses introduced by `who` cannot be split, follow the original rules
	- `Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward`
	- `My cousin Bob is a talented harpist`

#### Rule 4: Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause

- `The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape`

#### Rule 5: Do not join independent clauses with a comma

- Use a semicolon
	- `It is nearly half past five: we cannot much town before dark.`
- Or comma, see [[#Rule 4 Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause|rule 4]]
- Even if a adverb is used to bridge, a semicolon is still needed
	- `I had never been in the place before; besides, it has dark as a tomb.`

#### Rule 6: Do not break sentences into two

- Don't use periods for commas
	- `She has a interesting taker. A woman who had traveled all over the world`

##### Exceptions

- Emphatic word or expression
	- `Again one again be called out. No reply`

#### Rule 7: Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation

- Usually follows an independent clause
- Not `Your dedicated whittler requires: a knife, a price of wood, and a back porch.`
- Should be `Your dedicated whittler requires three props: a knife, a piece of wood, and a back porch`
- Join the independent clauses with a colon if the second intercepts or amplify the first
- `But even so, there was a directness and dispatch about animal burial: there was no stopover in the undertaker's foul parlor, no wreath or spray.`
- A colon may introduce a quotation that supports or contributes to the preceding clause
	- `The squalor of the streets reminded her of a line from Oscar Wilde: "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."`

#### Rule 8: Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary

- A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a common less
formal than a colon, more relaxed than parentheses
- `His first thought on getting out of bed — if he had any thought at all — was to get back in again`

#### Rule 9: The number of the subject determines the number of the verb

- Words that intervene between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.
	- `The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials,its joys, its adventures, its challenges — is not soon forgotten.`
	- The youth is the subject and thus it should be `is` not `are` not soon forgotten
- `Each`, `either`, `everyone`, `everybody`, `neither`, `nobody`, and `someone` are singular
	- `Everybody thinks he has a unique sense of humor` (`thinks` instead of `think`)
- A compound subject, formed by two ore more nouns joined by and, require a plural verb
	- `The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand`
- Except for compounds that are a unit and subjects connected by `each` or
`every`
	- `Bread and butter was all she served` (`was` instead of `were`)
- Be careful of nouns that end with a `s` which appear to be plural even though they are singular
	- `The Republican Headquarters is on this side of the tracks`

#### Rule 10: Use the proper case of pronoun

- `We heavy eaters would rather walk than ride.`\
- `Who knocks?`
- In general, avoid "understood" verbs
	- Not `I think Horace admires Jessica more than I.`
	- Should be `I think Horace admires Jessica more than I do.`

#### Rule 11: A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject

- Assuming the woman is the one walking, its not `Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children`
- Should be `He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road`
- In `Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve` the clock is wondering

### Chapter 2: Elementary Principles of Composition

#### Rule 12: Choose a suitable design and hold to it

- Keep the shape of the writing consistent throughout the writing
- No rambling

#### Rule 13: Make the paragraph the unit of composition

- This rule has to do with when to split up paragraphs into multiple paragraphs
- Pretty much, just split it up whenever it feels like the point is over
- It can be as long or short as you want
- Dialogue, like in a book, is separated into it's own paragraph

#### Rule 14: Use the active voice

- Not `My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.`
- Should be `My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.`
- But still use passive it whenever seems necessary
	- This would be better if the focus is on the dramatists `The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.`
	- This one focus more on modern readers `Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.`

#### Rule 15: Put statements in positive form

- Avoid hesitating or noncommittal language
- Not `He was not very often on time.`
- Should be `He usually came late.`
- Not `She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one's time`
- Should be `She thought the study of Latin a waste of time`
- Negative words other than not are usually strong though

#### Rule 16: Use definite, specific, concrete language

- Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract
- Not `A period of unfavorable weather set in.`
- Should be `It rained every day for a week.`

#### Rule 17: Omit needless words

- `The question as to whether` can be replaced with `whether`
- `There is no doubt but that` can be replaced with `no doubt`
- `used for fuel purposes` can be replaced with `used for fuel`
- `he is a man who` can be replaced with `he`
- Absolutely no `the fact that`\
- `I was unaware of the fact that` can be replaced with `I was unaware that`

#### Rule 18: Avoid a succession of loose sentences

- Many short sentences becomes boring
- Vary sentence structure to not sound mononounous

#### Rule 19: Express coordinate ideas in similar form

- Not `It was both a long ceremony and very tedious.`
- Should be `The ceremony was both long and tedious`

#### Rule 20: Keep related words together

- Not `He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center` (Is the rug in the center or the stain?)
- Should be `He noticed a large stain right in the center of the rug`
- The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated
	- Not `Toni Morrison, in Beloved, writes about characters who have escaped from slavery but are haunted by its heritage.`
	- Should be `In Beloved, Toni Morrison writes about characters who have escaped from slavery but are haunted by its heritage`
- The relative pronoun should come immediately after its antecedent
	- Not `He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which were published in Harper's Magazine` (What was published? The articles? The adventures?)
	- Should be `He published three articles in Harper's Magazine about his adventures in Spain.`

#### Rule 21: In summaries, keep to one tense

- In summarizing the action of a drama, use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, also use the present, though you may use the past if it seems more natural to do so

#### Rule 22: Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end

- The proufound part of the sentence should come last
- Not `Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways.`
- Should be `Since that time, humanity has advanced in many ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude`

### Chapter 3: A Few Matters of Form

This is mostly directly taken from the book, but stripped down.

- **Colloquialisms**. If you use a colloquialism or a slang word or phrase, simply use it; do not draw attention to it by enclosing it in quotation marks
- **Exclamations**. Do not attempt to emphasize simple statements by using a mark of exclamation! *<- This is a example of what not to do*
- **Headings**. If a manuscript is to be su
- bmitted for publication, leave plenty of space at the top of page 1. Place the heading, or title, at least a fourth of the way down the page
- **Hyphen**. When two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is usually required. `She entered her boat in the round-the-island race`
- **Margins**. Keep righthand and lefthand margins roughly the same width
- **Numerals**. Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation, as appropriate. With an exception being in dialogue.
- **Parentheses**. A sentence containing an expression in parentheses is punctuated outside the last mark of parenthesis exactly as if the parenthetical expression were absent. `I went to her house yesterday (my third attempt to see her), but she had left town`
- **Quotations**. Formal quotations cited as documentary evidence are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks. `The United States Coast Pilot has this to say of the place: "Bracy Cove, 0.5 mile eastward of Bear Island, is exposed to southeast winds, has a rocky and uneven bottom, and is unfit for anchorage."`
- **References**. In scholarly work requiring exact references, abbreviate titles that occur frequently, giving the full forms in an alphabetical list at the end
- **Syllabication**. When a word must be divided at the end of a line, consult a dictionary to learn the syllables between which division should be made (*I did not realize that is a thing*)
- Titles. For the titles of literary works, scholarly usage prefers italics with capitalized initials

### Chapter 4: Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

- **Aggravate**. **Irritate**. The first means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or condition. The second means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."
- **All right**. Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed,"
- **Allude**. Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer
- **Allusion**. Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the second means "an unreal image"
- **Alternate**. **Alternative**. The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities
- **Among**. **Between**. When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually called for: `The money was divided among the four players.` When, however, more than 45 two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: `an agreement between the six heirs.`
- **And/or**. A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or ambiguity. `First of all, would an honor system successfully cut down on the amount of stealing and/or cheating?`
- **Anticipate**. Use expect in the sense of simple expectation
- **Anybody**. In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. Any body means `any corpse`. The rule holds equally for everybody, nobody, and somebody
- **Anyone**. In the sense of `anybody` written as one word. Any one means `any single person`
- **As good or better than**. Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentences. `My opinion is as good or better than his.`
- **As to whether**. Whether is sufficient
- **As yet**. Yet nearly always is as good, if not better
- **Being**. Not appropriate after regard … as. Not `He is regarded as being the best dancer in the club` should be `He is regarded as the best dancer in the club`
- **But**. Unnecessary after doubt and help. `I have no doubt but that`
- **Can**. Means "am (is, are) able." Not to be used as a substitute for may.
- **Care less**. The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not" mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys the meaning of the sentence and is careless indeed (*dang*)
- **Case**. Often unnecessary. `It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been made`
- **Certainly**. Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use very, in an attempt to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even worse in writing.
- **Character**. Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness
- **Claim**. Not to be used as a substitute for declare, maintain, or charge
- Clever. Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one (*haha*)
- **Compare**. To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order
- **Comprise**. Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprises mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it "embraces," or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo — they constitute a zoo.
- Consider. Not followed by `as` when it means `believe to be.` `I consider him as competent. `
- **Contact**. As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not contact people; get in touch with them.
- **Cope**. An intransitive verb used with with. In formal writing, one doesn't "cope," one "copes with" something or somebody.
- **Currently**. In the sense of now with a verb in the present tense, currently is usually redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time. Not `We are currently reviewing your application.` Should be `We are at this moment reviewing your application.`
- **Data**. Like strata, phenomena, and media, data is a plural and is best used with a plural verb. The word, however, is slowly gaining acceptance as a singular
- **Different than**. Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs from another, hence, different from. Or, other than, unlike
- **Disinterested**. Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not interested in."

This is taking forever and the test ended up being crazy easy so this is the end of this useless article, I hope you have a wonderful day!

# Elements of Style by Strunk and White

### Introduction

- Instructions like a sergeant giving instructions:
	- "Do not join independent clauses with a comma." ([[#Rule 5 Do not join independent clauses with a comma|Rule 5.]])
	- "Use active voice." ([[#Rule 4 Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause|Rule 14.]])
	- "Omit needless words!" (Rule 17.)
- The times had a headline: `Charles' Tonsils out.` But [[#Rule 1 Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's|Rule 1]]. says to form possessive singular of nouns by adding `'s` no matter the final consonant
- Style rules are a bit of a matter of preference

### Chapter 1: Elementary Rules of Usage

#### Rule 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's

Form the possessive singular of nouns
by adding `'s`. Follow this whatever the final constant is

##### Exceptions

- Ancient proper names ending in `-es` or `-is`
	- `Jesus'`
	- `Moses' Laws`
	- `Isis' Temple`
		- Though this is commonly written as the temple of Isis
- Pronominal Possessives `hers`, `its`, `theirs`, `yours`, and `ours`
	- `Its bag`
	- `It is hers`

#### Rule 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

Series of three or more terms with single
conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

- `Red, white, and blue`
- Business names are written as they choose
	- `Little, Brown and Company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette`

#### Rule 3: Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas

- `The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.`
- If the interruption is slight, commas can be omitted, otherwise commas should wrap the interruption
- Make sure you add it to both sides
- Abbreviations, titles, times and places
	- `If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.`
	- `Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided.`

##### Exceptions

- Restrictive term of identifications
	- `Billy the kid`
- Jr. abbreviation is restrictive
	- `James Wright Jr.`
- Clauses introduced by `which`, `when`, and `where` are nonrestrictive, don't limit or define anything in the sentence, so they should be separated into two sentences
	- `Napoleon was born in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been acquired by France.`
- Restrictive clauses, on the other hand, are not parenthetic
	- `People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.`
- Clauses introduced by `who` cannot be split, follow the original rules
	- `Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward`
	- `My cousin Bob is a talented harpist`

#### Rule 4: Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause

- `The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape`

#### Rule 5: Do not join independent clauses with a comma

- Use a semicolon
	- `It is nearly half past five: we cannot much town before dark.`
- Or comma, see [[#Rule 4 Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause|rule 4]]
- Even if a adverb is used to bridge, a semicolon is still needed
	- `I had never been in the place before; besides, it has dark as a tomb.`

#### Rule 6: Do not break sentences into two

- Don't use periods for commas
	- `She has a interesting taker. A woman who had traveled all over the world`

##### Exceptions

- Emphatic word or expression
	- `Again one again be called out. No reply`

#### Rule 7: Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation

- Usually follows an independent clause
- Not `Your dedicated whittler requires: a knife, a price of wood, and a back porch.`
- Should be `Your dedicated whittler requires three props: a knife, a piece of wood, and a back porch`
- Join the independent clauses with a colon if the second intercepts or amplify the first
- `But even so, there was a directness and dispatch about animal burial: there was no stopover in the undertaker's foul parlor, no wreath or spray.`
- A colon may introduce a quotation that supports or contributes to the preceding clause
	- `The squalor of the streets reminded her of a line from Oscar Wilde: "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."`

#### Rule 8: Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary

- A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a common less
formal than a colon, more relaxed than parentheses
- `His first thought on getting out of bed — if he had any thought at all — was to get back in again`

#### Rule 9: The number of the subject determines the number of the verb

- Words that intervene between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.
	- `The bittersweet flavor of youth — its trials,its joys, its adventures, its challenges — is not soon forgotten.`
	- The youth is the subject and thus it should be `is` not `are` not soon forgotten
- `Each`, `either`, `everyone`, `everybody`, `neither`, `nobody`, and `someone` are singular
	- `Everybody thinks he has a unique sense of humor` (`thinks` instead of `think`)
- A compound subject, formed by two ore more nouns joined by and, require a plural verb
	- `The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand`
- Except for compounds that are a unit and subjects connected by `each` or
`every`
	- `Bread and butter was all she served` (`was` instead of `were`)
- Be careful of nouns that end with a `s` which appear to be plural even though they are singular
	- `The Republican Headquarters is on this side of the tracks`

#### Rule 10: Use the proper case of pronoun

- `We heavy eaters would rather walk than ride.`\
- `Who knocks?`
- In general, avoid "understood" verbs
	- Not `I think Horace admires Jessica more than I.`
	- Should be `I think Horace admires Jessica more than I do.`

#### Rule 11: A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject

- Assuming the woman is the one walking, its not `Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children`
- Should be `He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road`
- In `Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve` the clock is wondering

### Chapter 2: Elementary Principles of Composition

#### Rule 12: Choose a suitable design and hold to it

- Keep the shape of the writing consistent throughout the writing
- No rambling

#### Rule 13: Make the paragraph the unit of composition

- This rule has to do with when to split up paragraphs into multiple paragraphs
- Pretty much, just split it up whenever it feels like the point is over
- It can be as long or short as you want
- Dialogue, like in a book, is separated into it's own paragraph

#### Rule 14: Use the active voice

- Not `My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.`
- Should be `My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.`
- But still use passive it whenever seems necessary
	- This would be better if the focus is on the dramatists `The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.`
	- This one focus more on modern readers `Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.`

#### Rule 15: Put statements in positive form

- Avoid hesitating or noncommittal language
- Not `He was not very often on time.`
- Should be `He usually came late.`
- Not `She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one's time`
- Should be `She thought the study of Latin a waste of time`
- Negative words other than not are usually strong though

#### Rule 16: Use definite, specific, concrete language

- Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract
- Not `A period of unfavorable weather set in.`
- Should be `It rained every day for a week.`

#### Rule 17: Omit needless words

- `The question as to whether` can be replaced with `whether`
- `There is no doubt but that` can be replaced with `no doubt`
- `used for fuel purposes` can be replaced with `used for fuel`
- `he is a man who` can be replaced with `he`
- Absolutely no `the fact that`\
- `I was unaware of the fact that` can be replaced with `I was unaware that`

#### Rule 18: Avoid a succession of loose sentences

- Many short sentences becomes boring
- Vary sentence structure to not sound mononounous

#### Rule 19: Express coordinate ideas in similar form

- Not `It was both a long ceremony and very tedious.`
- Should be `The ceremony was both long and tedious`

#### Rule 20: Keep related words together

- Not `He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center` (Is the rug in the center or the stain?)
- Should be `He noticed a large stain right in the center of the rug`
- The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated
	- Not `Toni Morrison, in Beloved, writes about characters who have escaped from slavery but are haunted by its heritage.`
	- Should be `In Beloved, Toni Morrison writes about characters who have escaped from slavery but are haunted by its heritage`
- The relative pronoun should come immediately after its antecedent
	- Not `He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which were published in Harper's Magazine` (What was published? The articles? The adventures?)
	- Should be `He published three articles in Harper's Magazine about his adventures in Spain.`

#### Rule 21: In summaries, keep to one tense

- In summarizing the action of a drama, use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, also use the present, though you may use the past if it seems more natural to do so

#### Rule 22: Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end

- The proufound part of the sentance should come last
- Not `Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways.`
- Should be `Since that time, humanity has advanced in many ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude`

### Chapter 3: A Few Matters of Form

This is mostly directly taken from the book, but stripped down.

- **Colloquialisms**. If you use a colloquialism or a slang word or phrase, simply use it; do not draw attention to it by enclosing it in quotation marks
- **Exclamations**. Do not attempt to emphasize simple statements by using a mark of exclamation! *<- This is a example of what not to do*
- **Headings**. If a manuscript is to be su
- bmitted for publication, leave plenty of space at the top of page 1. Place the heading, or title, at least a fourth of the way down the page
- **Hyphen**. When two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is usually required. `She entered her boat in the round-the-island race`
- **Margins**. Keep righthand and lefthand margins roughly the same width
- **Numerals**. Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation, as appropriate. With an exception being in dialogue. 
- **Parentheses**. A sentence containing an expression in parentheses is punctuated outside the last mark of parenthesis exactly as if the parenthetical expression were absent. `I went to her house yesterday (my third attempt to see her), but she had left town`
- **Quotations**. Formal quotations cited as documentary evidence are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks. `The United States Coast Pilot has this to say of the place: "Bracy Cove, 0.5 mile eastward of Bear Island, is exposed to southeast winds, has a rocky and uneven bottom, and is unfit for anchorage."`
- **References**. In scholarly work requiring exact references, abbreviate titles that occur frequently, giving the full forms in an alphabetical list at the end
- **Syllabication**. When a word must be divided at the end of a line, consult a dictionary to learn the syllables between which division should be made (*I did not realize that is a thing*)
- Titles. For the titles of literary works, scholarly usage prefers italics with capitalized initials

### Chapter 4: Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

- **Aggravate**. **Irritate**. The first means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or condition. The second means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."
- **All right**. Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed,"
- **Allude**. Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer
- **Allusion**. Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the second means "an unreal image"
- **Alternate**. **Alternative**. The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities
- **Among**. **Between**. When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually called for: `The money was divided among the four players.` When, however, more than 45 two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: `an agreement between the six heirs.`
- **And/or**. A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or ambiguity. `First of all, would an honor system successfully cut down on the amount of stealing and/or cheating?`
- **Anticipate**. Use expect in the sense of simple expectation
- **Anybody**. In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. Any body means `any corpse`. The rule holds equally for everybody, nobody, and somebody
- **Anyone**. In the sense of `anybody` written as one word. Any one means `any single person`
- **As good or better than**. Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentences. `My opinion is as good or better than his.`
- **As to whether**. Whether is sufficient
- **As yet**. Yet nearly always is as good, if not better
- **Being**. Not appropriate after regard ... as. Not `He is regarded as being the best dancer in the club` should be `He is regarded as the best dancer in the club`
- **But**. Unnecessary after doubt and help. `I have no doubt but that`
- **Can**. Means "am (is, are) able." Not to be used as a substitute for may.
- **Care less**. The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not" mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys the meaning of the sentence and is careless indeed (*dang*)
- **Case**. Often unnecessary. `It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been made`
- **Certainly**. Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use very, in an attempt to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even worse in writing.
- **Character**. Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness
- **Claim**. Not to be used as a substitute for declare, maintain, or charge
- Clever. Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one (*haha*)
- **Compare**. To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order
- **Comprise**. Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprises mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it "embraces," or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo — they constitute a zoo.
- Consider. Not followed by `as` when it means `believe to be.` `I consider him as competent. `
- **Contact**. As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not contact people; get in touch with them.
- **Cope**. An intransitive verb used with with. In formal writing, one doesn't "cope," one "copes with" something or somebody.
- **Currently**. In the sense of now with a verb in the present tense, currently is usually redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time. Not `We are currently reviewing your application.` Should be `We are at this moment reviewing your application.`
- **Data**. Like strata, phenomena, and media, data is a plural and is best used with a plural verb. The word, however, is slowly gaining acceptance as a singular
- **Different than**. Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs from another, hence, different from. Or, other than, unlike
- **Disinterested**. Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not interested in."

> Unique. Means "without like or equal." Hence, there can be no degrees of uniqueness.

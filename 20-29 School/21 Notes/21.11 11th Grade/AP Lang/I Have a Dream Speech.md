# I Have a Dream Speech  
  
Martin Luther King, Jr.  
  
- Martin Luther King addresses the audience of 250,000 people *a whole lot of people* at the 1963 March on Washington.  
> “Five score” (or one hundred) years ago  
- Luther references Abraham Lincoln who signed the Emaciation Proclamation which ended slavery and was a major step in equality, but Luther says, even 100 years later, Black Americans still aren't truly free  
> One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination  
- *Imagery of chains and manacles which are associated with slavery to describe Black American's lives in America*  
> America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds  
- *Metaphor comparing America's founding documents like the Constitution and Declaration of Independence to a bad check*  
- *They were promised all this freedom and great things in these documents, but when they tried to use their freedom (cash the check) they couldn't because the funds weren't available*  
> We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency  
- Luther wants change to happen now and reminds America of the urgency of the situation  
- *For over 200 years people believed things would slowly get better as time passed, but Luther is arguing it won't just magically get better, they need to act now*  
> Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children  
- *Luther, a Baptist preacher, invokes the idea that this is not a physical need, but a spiritual one that both white and Black Americans are children of god*  
> In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds  
- As Luther is getting everybody fired up and ready to act, he tames the energy a bit to make sure it doesn't turn into chaos and violence *which would ruin everything*  
- He continues to describe instead of using physical means, they gain a intellectual advantage and use "soul force" to fight  
- Transform their rage into nonviolent action  
> The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people  
- Luther also wants to make sure there is no hate for white Americans which would cause further separation, not what hes going for  
> We cannot walk alone.  
- Luther furthers that point by saying neither white Americans or Black Americans should walk alone  
> "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.  
- Luther goes on to describe all the ways Black Americans are miss treated in rapid succession  
- Not victimized by police, allowed to use the same accommodations  
> We will not be satisfied until "justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."  
- They should never stop  
> I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations  
- King goes on to talk to those who had to go though lots of hardship describing the hardship he knows they had to go though  
- Tells them they can go back to South Carolina, Georgia etc back to their homes they had to run away from and keep their head up high  
> I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream  
- Luther begins laying out the dream he has about future America, stating the dream is based on America's founding dream  
> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal  
- Shows how what they are fighting for is not a dream or a crazy wish, but something that should be already part of American life  
> I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  
> I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  
- He says the people of America shouldn't just be equal by the government, but he wants the people of America to genuinely respect one another as brothers  
> I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  
- He brings up his kids to remind the audience that he is not just fighting for the people, but he is one of them  
- *The audience can connect with someone who is more like them much easier*  
> Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  
- Luther is from Alabama and he hopes the racists will lose political and social power and that even in Alabama both races can be together  
> With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  
- Although religion is interlaced throughout the whole speech, Luther uses this section to focus on the spiritual reasons for his dream  
> Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.  
> Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.  
- Luther goes on like this for a bunch of states trying to capture the energy of those from that state  
- *When such a big figure calls on you by name you feel more heard and he is more like you*  
> And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:  
> 	Free at last! Free at last!  
> 	Thank God Almighty, we are free at last  
- Luther hopes when this happens America can sing “My Country ‘Tis of Thee” a song sung by a white person about the freedoms they (white people) have in America  
- The Black people will be able to sing patriotic songs written by white people because they will be free as well
